 abstract = {This article presents an overview of the achievements of Maksim Shapir, a leading Russian scholar who died prematurely in 2006. He is the author of some 200 works covering a wide range of disciplines in the humanities, including the history and theory of Russian verse, the theory of poetic language, linguistic poetics, textology, the history of literature, semiotics, the logic and methodology of science, and the history of Russian philology. Among Shapir's principal accomplishments is his original general theory of verse. His main intellectual thrust was the isomorphism and homology of form and content. Shapir expanded the idea of the potential meaningfulness of form and applied it to all levels and aspects of poetic language, including orthography and punctuation; it is on this thesis that Shapir's conception of textual criticism is based. In addition, he posed the question of historical grammar of Russian verse and developed a new model of macro-evolution of Russian poetic styles.},

The same process may be seen in the works of Velimir Khlebnikov. An entire story, idea or trope in one of his works is shortened to a mere hint in another work, or an allusion to an existing story becomes part of a new construction. We see this process of condensing and extension for instance in KhlebnikovÊ¼s poem âI esli Kharkovskie ptitsyâ¦â (1921), which is analysed in the article.},

Tolstaia's characters, events, and tropes reuse and reassemble Dostoevskii's images. Psychoanalytic textual analysis explains these connections as censored text encoded in metaphors and metonymies. The idea of censorship, taken broadly as censorship of life on the basis of literary standards, is presented as the unifying theme of the two texts. The spiritual âundergroundâ of Dostoevskii's character and the âundergroundâ artistic world of Tolstaia's story are shown to be the reverse sides of the same phenomenon of literary censorship.},

 abstract = {This paper offers a genealogy of Roman-themed writing in recent Russian cultural history, with special attention for so-called âSoviet antiquityâ â that is, the extent to which allusions to the history of Ancient Rome were used and allowed within officially accepted Soviet literature. The author maps and compares different instances of interest towards Roman antiquity among poets of the second half of the twentieth century. She demonstrates that there was a strong tendency towards using Roman subject matter as part of the Aesopian language of the time, transforming covert messages into explicit expressions of the authorâs viewpoint. More pointedly, the author unpacks the social and literary context of Rome-inspired Jaan Kaplinskiâs (âVercingetorixâ) and David Samoilovâs (âRemus and Romulusâ) lyric poetry, as well as their relationship with Classical subject matter and nineteenth-century civil poetry. The analysis also traces how Roman mythologemes developed in writings by coeval poets. In their work, ancient exempla morph into a source for ideological and literary creation. Bulat Okudzhavaâs poem âRoman Empireâ is analysed as an act of reflection about the tradition of allegory in civil poetry, and as a mark of the poetâs weariness of Aesopian language in historical situations like the decline of the Roman Empire.},

 abstract = {In the present paper those of Sumarokov's psalm paraphrases are analyzed which he published in 1774, three years before his death.

@article{AMI2017153,
 abstract = {Symbolist criticism of Nikolai Gogolâ from the turn of the 20th century is important for the history of his reception as a novelist. The Symbolist literary community was of prime importance for the evaluation of the Gogolian heritage and I will argue that their criticism contributed to the myth-making surrounding his work and person. These myths arose from early Symbolist discourse â the âdiabolic paradigmâ â including prominently Vasilii Rozanovâs interpretation of Gogolâ himself as the sorcerer in his short story âStrashnaia mestââ (âThe Terrible Vengeanceâ). The genesis and evolution of Symbolist myths are examined, and reconsidered, including the movementâs own critique of these myths. Also, I will elaborate how and why young Symbolists surrounding D. Merezkovskii developed their own motives and ideas with respect to Rozanovâs myth of Gogolâ. For them, Gogolâs personality and work function as a mirror and a vehicle for their self-definition. Finally, I will argue that what the young Symbolists reveal in Gogolâs work and personality are prophetic signs of Russiaâs apocalyptic and uncertain future.},

 abstract = {Maksim Shapir was preparing this paper for the present issue of Russian Literature at the time of his death. The text was fully conceived, but he did not finish writing it. Only his working materials were preserved, and are published here. Shapir's approach is as follows. Bakhtin/Voloshinov's book expresses totalitarian, anti-philological, postmodernist ideology. For them, the sign is social: there is no ideology without the sign, nor any sign without social ideology. Language is considered as superstructure and an arena of class struggle; thus, they are close to Marr. They envisage every word as ideologically charged and evaluative: just as, for Lenin, any literature expresses party affiliation. Consciousness is realized in semiotic, socially oriented form: personal space is suppressed by social space. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, understanding is a dialogue, while philology is a monologue: dialogism (as adaptation of the text to new needs) is preferred to philologism (as understanding of the work in the context of its creation). Such anti-philologism makes this book the earliest expression of postmodernist ideology.},

In comparing the staffâs behavior with monastic asceticism and coenobitic life, the author conveys the subtle message that while traditional models of sanctity may need to be updated, the underlying emphasis on right daily conduct toward oneâs fellow human beings should remain at the center of societyâs ethical values.},

 abstract = {The study aims to reconstruct Mikhail BakhtinÊ¼s literary approach in the twofold light of his language concept as well as his philosophical writings. It presents his way as a thinker from his Neo-Kantianism through phenomenological aesthetics to the concept of personalism accomplished in his major dialogue theory. The author discusses in detail BakhtinÊ¼s early intonation theory and its role in the shaping of the original concept of speech genres and prose poetics, with a particular emphasis on the role of the âphilosophy of the actâ in the genesis of the concept of discourse. Such base categories are re-considered as the âact-centreâ, âthe incidence of existenceâ, âarchitectonicsâ, âintonational metaphorâ, the âtwo-voice wordâ, âinternal wordâ. Moreover, special attention is paid to BakhtinÊ¼s debate with GyÃ¶rgy LukÃ¡cs on the novel as well as to the links to Max Scheler in relation with philosophical personalism.},

In the late 1920s, factographyâs leader Sergei Tretâiakov arrived at a pragmatic turn in his practice of âoperative factographyâ, similar to what occurred later in philosophy of language. Analyzing this self-reflexive and self-critical literary practice from the perspectives of narratology and post-formalist micro-sociology, it is proposed that estrangement (âostranenieâ) is intrinsic to the very act of utterance.},

 abstract = {A common university joke goes that in order to complete the first-year program at a faculty of philology, one has to read not less than a thousand pages daily during the academic year. The number of works and commentaries increases every year and catalogues are swelling, putting modern philologists in an ever more difficult position. The rapid digitalizing of old texts and the exponentially growing number of new ones during the last decade hardly allow any works to escape the professional eye. Accessibility is turning into information overload, and philologists are becoming unable to see the forest behind the trees. The abundance of texts, provoked exclusively by technology, cannot be conquered merely by recommending perseverance or cultivating the love of reading: there is a need for a whole new way of being a philologist. This article examines the new quantitative formalism from a historical critical perspective. Formalism did not evade âbiological biasâ even at the time of its formation and specification as a method: it would be odd to expect that it could be evaded at the stage of the hybridization of literary science and methodological convergence.},

Kim paved the way for his career as a bard, though he had the chance to sing on the official youth stages. Nonconformist criticism of Soviet politics is heard in his uncensored songs. After 1968 Kim's works had two statuses: semiofficial, pseudonymous songs for the stage and the film, and unofficial songs for a narrow circle of people who shared his ideas. Some of the songs of the first category are known throughout the country, with other, no less brilliant songs, he earned a reputation as a dissident singer.},

Lately, the peculiarity of expression by means of sounds, sound repetition and âsound-writingâ (zvukopisÊ¼) are increasingly being researched in connection with the specificity of anagrammatism, conscious or unconscious collision of words in the sound stream. The analysis of the sound structure of PlatonovÊ¼s works reveals that the rich phonetic organization of the text, the sound associations, repetitions, paronyms and anagrams significantly reinforces the artistic expression. There is a clear tendency to bring words together on the basis of sound similarities and to create anagrams-leitmotivs from key words and names. In his early works Platonov often concealed the clandestine names of friends or family members in the text, in later works the anagrams often denoted important concepts of his world outlook.},

 abstract = {The article addresses the function of foreign languages in Aigi's poetry and, more broadly, the role of multilingualism in the bilingual's poetic intellection. In particular, the foreign language acts as a method of encoding taboo (or sacred) objects in different contexts where the poet turns the common practice of bilingual hedging into an artistic device. The bilingual poet needs a third language that serves as an intermediary between the first two languages and all other languages and as a bridge to the super-language. For Aigi, the third language involved in the cultural transfer was French. Orientation towards a universal language requires not only an absolute translatability through neutralization of specific categories, such as gender and case, but also a possibility of perception of a foreign text without translation. The intellection of a bilingual poet facilitates semiotic transitions of different types, providing for the fact that the explicit element of visuality, which was innovative in the 1960s, is specifically present in the bilingual poet's production.},

@article{AZAROVA2019275,
 abstract = {The essay discusses the changeable ways in which the subject is indicated by means of the pronoun âweâ (âÐ¼Ñâ) in contemporary Russian poetry. Although âweâ is much less frequently dispensed with as a strategy than âIâ, the use of the conventional poetic âweâ, which expresses so-called universal thoughts, has greatly diminished. Rather, poets tend to use the first person plural with caution and consciously to avoid it. Embodying the opposition of the public to the private, âweâ remains a certain marker of ideology in poetry, especially when it deals with the subjective past. The beginning of the twenty-first century is characterized by persistent introduction of scientific discursive practices into the poetic text, which leads to an increase in use of the authorâs scholarly âweâ. Contemporary poetry reveals an explicit increase in a motile âweâ that does not establish manifest boundaries of the self: the âweâ of fear, the âweâ of dream, the âweâ of flight, etc., which can be united under the term âcognitive weâ. This motile âweâ accommodates an indefinitely multiple subject and is ultimately expressed as a feminine âweâ. This âweâ transcends the oppositions of subjectivity vs. non-subjectivity and wholeness vs. disintegration.},

This essay returns to the fantastic elements that contaminate Aitmatovâs late-Soviet text not as a historiography of the authorâs present, as Fredric Jameson would put it, but as an experiment in composing parabolas of the Anthropocene. Both as a geometric figure and as a fugitive cosmopolitics, parabolas inscribe a novel spacetime in which deep histories of colonial violence and dislocation intersect with futuristic arcs of planetary devastation, rewriting the Russian and Soviet empireâs Central Asian periphery into a generative epicenter of ecological storytelling.},

 abstract = {My paper explores how, through the lens and language of hunger in literary texts, we can appreciate some important aspects of modern Russian culture. A faithful companion of wars, revolutions, and great changes during the turbulent periods in Russia's twentieth-century history, hunger feeds the literary imagination. Eating in siege-texts is perceived not merely as a physical function, but also as a social agent. And these periods of actual starvation gave rise in the literature to a poignant imagination of the consumption of food. Food, I argue, conveyed both the negative and positive perceptions of the world â thoughts of both lack and abundance. We can agree with Terry Eagleton that âfood is endlessly interpretableâ and eating can be perceived as âa combination of biological necessity with cultural significanceâ. We see a striking example of the transformation of historical hunger and material lack into a common bond that stirs communal imagination in Lidiia Ginzburg's Blockade Diary (Zapiski blokadnogo cheloveka, 1942-1962-1983).},

I shall ask how the representation of the world around her mediates a distinctive transfer of visual images into verbal images. How does GuroÊ¼s visual, and aural attentiveness, as manifested in the fragmentariness of the narration itself, reflect the sensibility of her narrative persona, âa female flaneurâ, who is a modern woman strolling along city streets? A whole taxonomy of sights and discordant sounds forms a âpictureâ of the city street and the city itself. An arsenal of visual signs that GuroÊ¼s persona observes signals a transfer from the acoustic to the visual. GuroÊ¼s work, moreover, provides numerous examples of the transfer of âpainterlyâ devices to poetry, an important factor in the poetics of the prose poem. Her painterÊ¼s/writerÊ¼s eye envisions for her reader a unique consciousness of scene, while helping us to translate and interpret the âtextâ of the city and nature, their metaphors and representations.},

 abstract = {This article analyzes the book of poems Missa in tempore belli. Messa vo vremena voiny (Missa in tempore belli. War-Time Liturgy) by the Ukrainian author Boris Khersonskii. The book is dedicated to current political events, but did not receive coverage in Russian journals. This article analyzes the book of poetry as a complex art unity, formed not only through thematic leitmotifs, but also by way of subject organization, architectonics and framing texts. The author uses liturgy to rationalize the chaos of historical events, translating them into a trans-historic aspect. The abundance of negative word formations are linked to apophaticism and the lyric heroâs view of inter-ethnic conflicts, the origins of which he locates in the Soviet past. The central concept for determining Khersonskiiâs position becomes the ritual of the Eucharist (Holy Communion). The author links this work with M.Â Voloshinâs Putiami Kaina (Ways of Cain) and current political poetry, and comments on Khersonskiiâs poetic strategy and new trends of âpost-documentalityâ in contemporary art emphasizes.},

 abstract = {The article makes an attempt to sound the novelty of Virginia Woolf's and Boris Pasternak's literary theory in the context of literary tradition. I argue that at least in two crucial fields, in the definition of the self and the treatment of the relationship of art and reality, it is the paradigm established by the Romantics that seems to be the most important point of reference. In order to prove this, I discuss both the authors' statements about romanticism and the romantic traits in their philosophies of art. Some of their concepts relevant to the topic (for example, Woolf's moments of being, or Pasternak's idea of creative subjectivity), expounded mainly in âA Sketch of the Pastâ and in A Safe Conduct, and the Romantic influences on their work are in the focus of the paper.},

 abstract = {This study aims to explore characteristic linguistic patterns to express narrowing, correction and reformulation in Dostoevskii's literary works. Particular attention is paid to the description of the function, meaning and features of these discourse markers in relation to the mental representations they evoke. The high frequency of discourse markers in Dostoevskii's literary works seems to be related to his constant control over speech, especially over the collision and overlap of mental representations that occur during reading. For that reason, this article tends to be framed within the scope of the negotiation of meaning during literary text comprehension in the general context of the relationships between language, culture and discourse in Russian. The proposed analysis may therefore contribute not only to the study of Dostoevskii's works and poetics, but also to the comprehension and explanation of discursive mechanisms of reformulation in Russian.},

 abstract = {Gombrowicz's work was first noticed in Holland in 1959. In the sixties followed the first translation of his novels Ferdydurke and Pornography into Dutch. When a selection from the Diary was to be published, Gombrowicz agreed on a translation not from the Polish, but from the German and French, a task that was accomplished by the translator Paul Beers, who subsequently translated the largest part of Gombrowicz's oeuvre into Dutch, while propagating it as an editor of the literary magazine De Revisor. Paul Beers considers Gombrowicz a writers' writer, who addresses himself to the (intellectually) young. The history of Gombrowicz's reception in the Netherlands reached its culmination in 1986, when the complete translation of the Diary appeared, accompanied by a special issue of De Revisor. Since that time the interest in Gombrowicz's work gradually diminished. But just now, in 2007, a reprint appears of a somewhat shortened edition of the Diary, followed in 2008 by Ferdydurke and the Short Stories.},

In the case of these three poets, those forms involve translinguistic and visual language structures, and the creation of totemic linguistic artifacts. To read such work, one must first experience it through a supreme suspension of disbelief, and then one may rationally consider that experience. Collaboration is especially apt for this transrationalist approach, in that it is in a sense âegolessâ, and transcends the social being that is formed by our everyday individualistic rational mind.

The typology of lie/deceit that is in general significant for GogolÊ¼ attains additional overtones in âThe Carriageâ; in this sense Chertokutskii, the protagonist of the story, parallels Chichikov, Nozdrev, and Khlestakov. The spatial structure of âThe Carriageâ represents a special importance for the poetics of the story. The emphasized absence of any movement in the described reality of âThe Carriageâ paradoxically contrasts multiple references to the means of conveyance in the text. The lack of any dÃ©nouement focuses the story on its textual properties superimposing the authorÊ¼s artistic worldview onto the minor anecdotic incident.},

 abstract = {The article analyses the way men are portrayed in Marian PankowskiÊ¼s prose, which may be characterised as strongly male and linguistically novel. His literary project is founded on the tension between the official and the private, between culture and unbounded (frequently perverse) eroticism, between the colloquial and the lyrical language. Relationships between men (sometimes taking the form of a classic homosocial community) are very important in this project. Attention is drawn to situations in which social mores are disturbed or taboos violated due to the collision (and intermingling) of BatailleÊ¼s âsphere of nightâ with the safe âsphere of productionâ. Robert BlyÊ¼s approach forms the starting point as it underpins menÊ¼s studies and closely coincides with PankowskiÊ¼s novels, being attuned to rites of passage and to social or mental male interdependence. The texts examined in the essay are Matuga idzie (Here Comes Matuga), Rudolf, Putto, Bal WdÃ³w i WdowcÃ³w (WidowsÊ¼ and WidowersÊ¼ Ball) and a survey of menÊ¼s attitudes, the novella Ostatni zlot anioÅÃ³w (The Last Convention of Angels).},

 abstract = {The article discusses some particular features of the âzaumnyjâ (transrational) work of Ry Nikonova and Sergej Sigej. The central problem is how to grasp intuitively transrational texts, the possibility or impossibility to decipher such texts. Various approaches are suggested, which may lead to an âunderstandingâ of the transformational poetics of the authors. It turns out that understanding is only possible if one becomes totally immersed in the text and can make free associations. This challenges the hypothesis of the inaccessibility of avant-gardist writing. Meaning originates on the level of the text in its entirety. Moreover, the text becomes a part of the general avant-garde paradigm, both diachronically and synchronically.},

The main system-forming theme of the philosophy of this Russian writer is the âsymbolâ. At the foundation of his âsymbolismâ there lies a belief in the direct connection between symbol and time. In this article, the evolution of Andrei BelyiÊ¼s views concerning the nature of time will be considered. To this end, we shall draw on his publications of the early 1900s; early 1910s; early 1920s; and, finally, Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD). In his main philosophical treatise, Belyi effects a synthesis of the theories of Heraclitus and Parmenides surrounding the fluidity and immutability of human existence. Time, in his interpretation, turns out to be nothing other than the filling in of emptiness â the eternal movement of human thought toward the ultimate goal of self-consciousness, called .},

By marking Christmas through occasional verses, it seems that Brodsky is trying to â at least for a brief moment â abolish, or rather forget about the linearity of time, which in his poetic philosophy (and unlike Christian doctrine) does not imply time's vector-like orientation towards the salvation of human kind, but its relentless progress towards nihility. By all accounts, Christmas for Brodsky does not only mark the beginning of our era's countdown, but also is a holiday celebrating the beginning of eternal annual cycles which people start with a belief in the return of the fullness of life and the renewal of their own vital forces.},

 abstract = {The article analyses a short story by Evgenii Popov titled âKak s"eli petukhaâ (âHow the Rooster Was Eatenâ) or, more precisely, analyses meanings which the rooster has in the text as a festive New-Year dish. Based on culinary binary oppositions that Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss used to describe the nutritional habits of various European and non-European nations, the author of this article reduces the basic collision of Popov's story to a dichotomy between the food of vegetable origin and the food of animal origin or, more concretely, to an opposition between a non-meat soup on the one hand and the rooster on the other as two opposed variants of the New-Year feast. The author also aims to show that the semantic opposition between vegetarianism and âcarnivorousnessâ is multidimensional, i.e. that beside the sensory-corporeal it also includes many other dimensions of human existence: in the context of Soviet culture it points also to the opposition between the poor and the bourgeois, the ideologically acceptable and the ideologically unacceptable, the everyday and the festive, the profane and the sacred. The article, finally, aims to shed light on a deeper and today slightly forgotten layer of meanings that the rooster has had in opposition to the non-meat soup: the rooster is not just a profane-gourmet, but also a ritually sacrificial food that is prepared only for festivities as a token for a better future, i.e. as a symbolic trade for a future wellbeing and good fortune of the votive offerer.},

However, I do not study transfer of specific images and motifs, but rather transfer of structural principles. In the centre of my interest are those texts by Sologub which can be characterized as minimalist. The minimalist tendencies of SologubÊ¼s Little Fairy Tales I have in mind are not expressed only in the storiesÊ¼ shortness, but also in reductionist techniques that simplify their narrative structure to a significant extent. In these simplifications, which primarily concern those of the narrator, character and plot, Sologub most frequently looks up to the poetics of the Russian folk tale. By transferring reductionist devices from narrative folklore to his little fairy tales, he in fact attempts to renew the irrational, mythical experience of the world which he considers much more acceptable and true than the contemporary realistic-scientific interpretation of reality.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to formulate a typology of monster imagery in Russian postmodern fiction. Literary monsters are categorised according to the presence of anthropomorphic traits in their psychophysical makeup. The paper pays special attention to a prevailing tendency in postmodernist fiction. The author argues that Russian postmodernists (most notably, Iurii Mamleev, Tatâiana Tolstaia, Viktor Pelevin, Vladimir Sorokin, Viktor Erofeev, and Dmitrii Prigov) almost neutralise the traditional opposition between the hero and the monster familiar from ancient heroic epos, which results in the impossibility of distinguishing between them. Moreover, the analysis in this paper uncovers a metathesis of opposition, in which often the hero is transformed into the monster (as in Tatâiana Tolstaiaâs novel The Slynx), or, alternatively, the monster becomes the hero (as in Viktor Pelevinâs novel Empire V). Finally, the paper tries to answer why much Russian postmodernist fiction tends to merge hero and monster and introduce a porous boundary between the human and the monstrous.},

 abstract = {The borrowing of certain principles of text structure or other elements from drama are typical ways to dramatize a poem. Dramatization became a widespread phenomenon in Russian poetry of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Dramatized poems can be divided into two groups: 1) texts in which we can clearly see elements of drama, such as stage directions, dramatis personae, the names of characters indicated before their speech, etc.; and 2) texts with no explicit dramatic elements but divided into conversational turns in which each utterance can potentially be attributed to a different speaker. Both types of dramatization allow us to see the creation of a new kind of subject in Russian poetry â the multiple subject. In dramatized poems we see a subject but not a persona (liricheskii geroi, according to Tynianov), because the utterances of multiple speakers cannot be united in a non-contradictory image of a single persona. At the same time, they can provide a basis for reconstructing the subject. It is important to emphasize that both strategies of dramatization imply a communicative space represented in the text that is similar in structure to space in drama. We can postulate the correspondence between the multiple subject and dramatization as a formal tool (priem).},

Smells and aromas are varied and multifunctional; their meaning is determined by natural and cultural models and mystical, biographical and erotical contexts. In his interpretation of olfactory sensations Kuzmin is guided by existing attitudes on smell, but also creates new concepts. As artistic elements smells have the function of cultural signs. In olfactory poetics we can find significant information, connected with corporality, intuition, memory and imagination. Kuzmin's olfactory preferences are determined by the perfume fashion of his time. The smells embody the author's wish to be âAnotherâ, to change masks and to play.},

My approach will be an intermedial one and I will analyse it in relation to the famous productions at the Mariinskii Opera in 1910 and in 1919. The task will be to scrutinize the relationship between the text of the poem and various paratexts, or, in the words of Derrida (1987) and broader, the relation between ergon and parergon. The focus is on the aesthetic impact of these relations more than on the question of genesis or influence. The basis for the interpretation will be the opposition between the period of the performance and the post-performance time, as well as the notion of liminality. The poem will be analysed against the background of the motif of the exit from the theatre in Russian 19th century Russian culture both in relation to literature and to a lithography from 1843 made by Rudol'f Zhukovskii. I will, however, use in particular material concerning the opera performance alluded to in the poem.},

 abstract = {An analysis of Gombrowicz's attitude towards science shows that it is based on an oxymoron: science does not lead to real knowledge about the world, but âmuddlesâ and âreducesâ. Gombrowicz was very much aware of the opposition between art and science, yet he was not prepared to accept the early modernist idea of âart for art's sakeâ. He perceived in this concept the same striving for âeconomy, purity, quintessenceâ that had led science astray, alienating it from reality. Especially dangerous was the demand of âobjectivityâ. Paradoxically this scientific postulate had been accepted by modernist art as its own âinternal valueâ. According to Gombrowicz art should not follow the lead of science, but shake off its fetters. The author should not attempt to hide his self, but expose it to its utmost. Here we are confronted with a fresh paradox. Gombrowicz's hostility to science seems, from the point of the development of social science, a misunderstanding. It could even be argued that several areas of contemporary scientific humanities were created by him. Of course, these areas are not (in Gombrowicz's case) the objects of ordinary scientific research. They are acts of âWitold Gombrowiczâ, apprehending himself.},

 abstract = {The paper presents a survey of stable compositional models and basic components of MaiakovskiiÊ¼s imagery system found by the poet as early as in his cycle book I! (Ia!). A new viewpoint is proposed on the problem of the subject of utterance in the notorious verse âI like to watch children dieâ (âIa liubliu smotretÊ¼, kak umiraiut detiâ); the original way of treating the âfather and sonâ conflict in the culmination point of the cycle (âSome words about myselfâ â âNeskolÊ¼ko slov obo mne samomâ) is accounted for. It is demonstrated that the search for an idealistic incarnation of âpaternityâ obtains a further development in the poem âListen!â (âPoslushaite!â), inspired by Francis JammeÊ¼s lyric poetry, and further in the poems for children âWhat is good and what is bad?â (âChto takoe khorosho i chto takoe plokho?â). The genre and stylistic conventionality of poetry for children makes it possible for the author to interpret the situation from the position of a wise father and solve all the contradictions in a space dominated by the artistÊ¼s rational and humane will. âWhat is good and what is bad?â is a rendering of the eternal problem of good and evil in childrenÊ¼s language, the problem from which MaiakovskiiÊ¼s development as a poet started. The authors of the paper arrive at the conclusion that the cycle I! is not a mere precursor of MaiakovskiiÊ¼s further development but it appears to be the prototype of his artistic world.},

 abstract = {Computational approaches to literary studies have tended to fetishize Russian Formalism. The evolving canon of Digital Humanities scholarship shows persistent leanings on Formalism and the theoretical movements that emerged in its wake, including Prague School structuralism, discourse analysis, and semiotics. Twenty-first-century scholars relive the evolutions, embattled stances, and fraught histories of modern literary theory and its founding figures, whom they claim as their predecessors â from historical poetics to the social turn of discourse analysis. As scholars working in Digital Humanities and Russian literary studies, we attempt to examine the suggestive continuities between Russian literary theory and computational literary analysis. Focusing on the posited link between discourse analysis and topic modelling, we offer a case study of topic modeling using the full run of the academic journal Slavic Review. We briefly review the process of topic modeling for literary analysis, consider some insights from topic modeling Slavic Review and, for comparison, briefly consider two other prominent journals in the field â Slavic and East European Journal and Russian Review.},

In the first part, we establish what it means to consider literature more broadly in such terms according to its material and conceptual histories. The second part narrows our focus to principally two works by Nabokov: a scientific research article on the paleo-evolution and migration of neotropical Plebijinae and a passage from his chapter on butterflies in Speak, Memory which the author interprets as a fictionalization of his research findings. Reading Nabokovâs butterflies alongside Leanne Simpsonâs story of eel migration and Nishnaabeg survivance reveals an âart science practiceâ committed to building more-than-human imagined communities, based on relationships of responsibility, on the global and deep-time scales of the Anthropocene towards a Chthulucene that centres Indigenous knowledge and being.},

Gnedov is not a well known Futurist, so the extent to which they refer to him in their literary and critical work is unusual. Sigej has evolved his own forms based on Gnedov's text-less âPoÄma koncaâ (âPoem of the Endâ) and other poems. Aspects of Gnedov's work turn out to be deeply integrated into Sigej's, a fact he openly acknowledges. In contrast, although Nikonova notes that Gnedov's work was a precursor to her vacuum, gesture, and vector poetry, she emphasises the independence of her creative path over any sense of deliberate evolution. Nevertheless, some general thematic concerns â such as the absence of text and its replacement with other elements â can be traced to Gnedov's âPoÄma koncaâ. The article includes many previously unpublished works by Sigej and Nikonova and draws on the author's correspondence with them.},

 abstract = {This article considers the structure of Vladislav Khodasevich's Necropolis (Nekropol', 1939) in relation to the volume's critique of Symbolist life-creation (zhiznetvorchestvo). Necropolis compiles short memoir-portraits of various turn-of-the-century Russian writers. These acerbic pieces variously implicate life-creative behavioral codes in many of these Symbolist writers' tragic fates. I contend that the sequence in which these portraits appear enhances Necropolis' critique. The opening trio of portraits (on Nina Petrovskaia, Valerii Briusov, and Andrei Belyi) compel the reader to repeatedly experience the collapse of those writers' love triangle. Khodasevich thus highlights two things: the degree to which individual Symbolist lives are inevitably âtangledâ (in Khodasevich's words) with one another; and the life-creative mandate of reliving one-time, kairotic events. I also argue that Khodasevich's portrait of Maksim Gor'kii (the final piece in Necropolis) represents a counterpoint to the preceding Symbolist lives. Gor'kii's life is just as âtangledâ and artificial; however, he recognizes the falsity of his life-creative biography, and embraces the revisionist âennobling truthâ that Khodasevich offers him. Gor'kii's portrait thus throws Necropolis' more famous Symbolist content into relief, and demonstrates Khodasevich's prerogative to write his contemporariesâ biographies. Thus, Necropolis' critique of life-creation becomes more meaningful when one reads its constituent pieces as a unified whole.},

 abstract = {The Gothic aesthetic first appeared in Russian public discourse and literature in the immediate pre-revolutionary decades. It was deployed in satirical journals of the 1905 Revolutionary period to portray the tsarist regime as an inhuman and demonic force. The prerevolutionary tropes subsequently carried over into posters, satirical magazines, painting, music, and childrenâs literature in the early Soviet era. Satirical âGothic laughterâ figured in official Soviet propaganda and public discourse. Moreover, critics of the Soviet regime began to apply the Gothic as a tool to critique the despotic excesses of the new era. As Stalinism rose the Gothic, which had become perhaps too suggestive of political opposition, retreated from the mainstream of Soviet cultural life, with the exception of several works of childrenâs literature. Here it continued to exert influence and expressed the violence and terror of life under Stalin.},

The central tale, âMan in a Landscapeâ, is an Aesopian tour de force recapitulating in miniature the novel's unifying design. Its basic element is a spiral: retracing his route in memory, âthe authorâ reaches deepening levels of self-knowledge. The spiral is intersected by an elaborate set of parallels to Dante â mischievously inverted and perverted â as âthe authorâ searches for his Russian soul in the sunset of the Soviet empire. Insights generated at points of intersection are dramatized later in the novel.},

It focuses on a number of plays and narrative texts that were written by non-professional authors/readers in an attempt to come to terms with these secret organizations and the threat that they seemed to pose to society. Although most of these materials were written in the same vein as Sergei Naidenov's highly successful family drama Vaniushin's Children (1901), they attack the âblessingsâ of modern society (a more liberal upbringing of children, âpornographicâ literature), rather than the stultifying atmosphere of traditional Russian family life. While expressing a deep concern with the sexual morality and the spiritual development of youth, these texts are, above all, indicative of the increased freedom of expression after 1905 and of Russian readers' willingness to use it.},

 abstract = {In the 1920s, the LEF project moved the discussion about the role of âthings in filmâ â as metonymic and metaphoric, photogenic and functional, and as tools that filled gaps in the narrative, stood in for actors, or operated as generic markers â in a distinctly materialist direction. Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov were sharply criticized for turning things into symbols in their films. To avoid this aesthetic dispute, Tretâiakov advocated production scripts based on the dominance of material things over plot. Eisenstein, in his unfinished text âPlay of Objects' (âOb igre predmetovâ), offers another understanding of things in film. A film-thing (kinoveshchâ), in his reading, is first an image and therefore an attraction, a conglomeration of heterogeneous circuits, awakening different areas of association and triggering social emotions. Eisensteinâs ideas may have influenced Tretâiakovâs concept of the âbiography of thingsâ. At the same time, as this analysis demonstrates, theoretical discussion about things in film had no lasting impact on the material world depicted on the Soviet screen. Films and historical documents (diaries and memoirs, customs declarations or detention inventories) tell different stories about the life of objects in Soviet Russia.},

Whilst not denying PlatonovÊ¼s links to a number of modernist and avant-garde principles and practices, the article also argues that too exclusive an emphasis on modernism has led to a resistance to seeing Platonov in terms of a broadly conceptualised realist tradition.},

As a result, the events of the story are dulled, which helps produce impervious characters and self-destructive plots. These, in the end, were desirable qualities in the belief system of Kharms, who felt that a pure reality could only be attained by separating out the parts of the whole and that perfection consisted in reducing things to a state of zero. Consequently, the overuse of proper nouns is instrumental in reflecting Kharmsâ philosophical views and creating the world of the absurd in his works.},

 abstract = {Published in Venice in 1774 in the first volume of Viaggio in Dalmazia, the ballad appeared simultaneously in the Serbo-Croat original (Xalostna pjesanza plemenite Asan-Aghinize) and in Italian translation by the monk Alberto Fortis. Fortis' book â and not least the Hasanaginica itself â was received, read, disseminated and further translated with such enthusiastic interest that it may justly be compared to a modern âbestsellerâ. It is, therefore, not surprising that the dramatic âHasanaginicaâ-ballad with its grand passions of love and pain, obedience, shame and pride has served as a pretext for a number of Serbo-Croat dramatisations:I.1909, under the title of Hasanaginica, by the Croat Milan OgrizoviÄ;II.1976, also under the title of Hasanaginica, by the Serb Ljubomir SimoviÄ;III.1991, by the Croat Tomislav BakariÄ under the significantly altered title of Hasanaga.In comparison, it is to be seen that the reception and the processing of the ballad pretext in the three drama texts discussed here are very varied and extend even into the realms of current politics. Motif-constants in all the dramas are the unjust rejection of the wife on the grounds of unsuccessful, since paradoxical communication and her death of a broken â and not as her husband accuses her a petrified â heart. And it is certainly this connection of force, destruction and death, but also of transgression, communication and utopia (in the sense of Georges Bataille), which lends the Hasanaginica its general significance and its ageless fascination.},

His poetic structure takes, among other devices, signalments of folk mythology and tropes to veil the direct statement: metonyms, metaphors and personification (e.g. the figure of âUntruth/Nepravdaâ). In addition, with the aid of allusions and an elaborate anagram technique, he introduces into his work the tabooed name of Stalin, the main representative of the sham faÃ§ade of Soviet society.},

In doing so, Kazakov parodies the traditional legend as represented by Pushkin and other Russian writers. At the same time, he employs motifs emphasized by these writers â such as the road, exile, and Don Juan's poetic creativity â in order to reflect on the challenge of creating apolitical art that entirely avoids allusion to Soviet political issues.},

Though EvgenijÊ¼s suitability as a tragic hero has been called into question, no-one has ever seriously doubted the reality of his misfortune. By tracing the presence of two opposing narrative voices in the poem, the present article endeavours to show that âMednyi vsadnikâ is not in any sense a tragedy but a masterpiece of conventional narrative irony. As the narratorÊ¼s credibility is undermined and his version of events dismantled, it becomes clear that for the author Evgenii not only falls short of being a tragic hero but also fails to suffer a tragic fate. In the end, we are forced to realize that âMednyi vsadnikâ is not a parable about the ethics of power but a humorous reflection on the Romantic obsession with dreams.},

The present article sets out to show that the anomalies critics have occasionally discerned already here are not sporadic but sustained and programmatic, forming the basis of a highly subtle, intricately woven and ultimately definitive narrative irony in which the narrator comes to be seen as a profoundly disturbed urban snob who is praising the sentimental rural visions that haunt him against his better judgement.},

 abstract = {The image of Alexander Herzen in the English-speaking world has been shaped by such scholars as Isaiah Berlin, E.H. Carr, and Aileen Kelly. This discourse of English âHerzenismâ â in which Herzen figures as a post-war liberal in nineteenth-century clothing or, alternately, as a romantic idealist eccentric â inspired playwright Tom Stoppard to write the plays that form his Coast of Utopia trilogy (2002), which feature Herzen as their central character. Thomas Campbell's analysis of the trilogy's middle play, Shipwreck, in which Herzen's âfamily dramaâ is restaged by Stoppard, reveals how his reading of English Herzen scholars informs the play, which wittily reinforces the âmessageâ of the English Herzen about the dangers of philosophical idealism and historicism. Herzen the exile thus serves as a double for Stoppard, who (like Berlin) found a new identity after escaping from a regime supposedly generated by historicism run amok. As Campbell argues, the play also shows how the âother shoreâ never reached by Herzen and his comrades â the post-ideological, neoliberal utopia achieved by present-day transatlantic society â is forced by its contradictions and intellectual poverty to rehearse the ideological conflicts that gave birth to it, and to examine them for traces of a better order.},

 abstract = {Andrei Bitov addresses questions of man's purpose, of human imperfection, of how the human being fits into the landscape. Pavel Petrovich, a main character of âMan in the Landscapeâ, discusses the artist's attempt not just to reflect the world, but to understand. The human being lives in a narrow layer of reality, and, says Pavel Petrovich, the artist attempts to go from the earthly to the divine layer. That thread of striving, he says, is life. He asks what the human being's purpose is, and concludes that the Creator, as an artist, needs man to see and appreciate his creation.},

Kruglovâs writing is discussed in the theoretical contexts of postmodernist discourses on contemporary poetry and religion and socio-political contexts of contemporary Russia.},

It is argued that the intense research which was carried out in the area of language planning as a result could be partially responsible for the significant Soviet contribution to the further development of post-Saussurian structuralism and the functional grammar theory.},

 abstract = {This article attempts to substantiate Belyi's often puzzled-over claim that Chekhov was the âpedestal of Russian Symbolismâ by examining the resonances between approaches to the symbol in Chekhov, Belyi and Viacheslav Ivanov. In his stories and plays, Chekhov developed what seems like an anti-symbolic conception of human experience in which life's deepest, most significant moments are hidden and at variance with the visible world. As Chekhov's protagonists find their way into these mysteries, both afraid of, and hungry for, an external symbolism that would make sense of their experience, Chekhov formulates a complex relationship with the symbol, one that would help to provide the groundwork for Belyi and symbolist poetics of the 20th century.},

Despite this designation, he continues to be controversial, particularly in the Anglophone world, as some critics believe that Äapek never actually comprehended the character of evil. On the occasion of the 120th anniversary of Äapek's birth, this article re-examines some of the most important themes of Äapek's writing from the vantage point of current events and well-known literary scholars. As one of the first European authors to experiment with multi-perspective approaches, Äapek echoes Lacan in some of his early work, while anticipating existentialism and postmodernism. These approaches will be investigated alongside Äapek's own analyses of society and politics, particularly topical today.},

 abstract = {This article offers a synthetic description of the problem of the canon in the prose works of Marian Pankowski. The canon, which is understood in the text as a set of principles determining those articulations that are permitted in a given culture, appears to be a permanent frame of reference of the writerÊ¼s works. The author singles out three subsequent options that have been developed by Pankowski. The first one â from Matuga (1955) until the story âKozakâ (âThe Cossackâ, 1965) â concerned an attack on the canon with counterofficial contents; in this period the writer acted as an inhabitant and advocate of the margins, which require to be culturally represented. The second, subversive approach (Rudolf, Putto, Z Auszwicu do Belsen [From Auszwic to Belsen], 1980â2000) was realized through the staging of conflicts between official and forbidden contents; here the writer took on the role of a naÃ¯ve representative of official culture who gradually turns into a subversive while transforming the canon into a source of erotic phantasms. The third option (W stronÄ miÅoÅci [Towards Love], 2001; Bal wdÃ³w i wdowcÃ³w [The WidowsÊ¼ and WidowersÊ¼ Ball], 2006; Ostatni zlot anioÅÃ³w [The Last Convention of Angels], 2007) entails the restitution of the principle of the canon â understood as an individually established set of principles; here Pankowski puts into question the distinction between an official and a counterofficial culture, as he situates his hero-narrator in an indefinite realm â a realm that can only be organized by the individual production of norms.},

 abstract = {The sonorous presence of a voice intoning a poem triggers a number of experiential transformations, the most obvious being that the reader is turned into a listener, who cedes control of the temporality in which the poem is experienced. Another consequential effect of the aural experience of poetry is a reduction of the text's inherent polysemy, as the elements of prosody conspire to produce a sonorous âreadingâ that is necessarily an interpretation. At the same time, the voice that sounds the poem creates new, vocal polysemies, new problems for interpretation. In this article, I attempt to track some of the transformations that occur when the works of Boris Ryzhii, a poet to whom sincerity has frequently been ascribed, are given as vocal performances. How do we hear the âsincere authorial voiceâ of Ryzhii when his works are not read but spoken â or, more radically, when they are not spoken but sung?},

 abstract = {This article examines Brodsky's 1981 âFifth (Summer) Eclogueâ in the context not only of Virgil's âEclogue Vâ but also of two Russian writers who experiment with the pastoral: Pushkin and Nabokov. Following Virgil, Brodsky asks in his poem how it might be possible to transcend human time through participation in a creative community of poets. Even more importantly, he questions whether such participation must lead to a universalized ideal, an engulfing of the individual in the embrace of eternity. Brodsky concentrates on the infinitesimal details of the very particular locale of his northern Russian youth to oppose any possibility of generalization. This article demonstrates how Brodsky uses a finely-tuned optical âart of measurementâ to prove the dependence of an amorphous eternity on individual experiences of time and memory, particularly as they occur in and against a larger frame of cultural tradition. Parallels are drawn throughout between Brodsky's concentration on details of place and Nabokov's âscientificâ approach to poetry.},

@article{DEBRUYN2007401,
 abstract = {Only a few months after the publication of Ferdydurke (1937), two major voices in twentieth-century Polish literature, Bruno Schulz and Artur Sandauer, came up with the hypothesis that Karol Irzykowski's only novel PaÅuba (1903) was an immediate predecessor of Gombrowicz's novel. Although any such influence of PaÅuba on his first and most successful novel was categorically denied by the author himself, Gombrowicz must have been acquainted with at least some details of its exceptional literary form ever since he started writing his own experimental prose. The question remains, however, what made both Schulz and Sandauer conclude that Ferdydurke descended from PaÅuba â and from PaÅuba alone. The present article sets out to answer this question, not only by elucidating what the two critics might have thought about the connection between both novels, but also by adding some new arguments from a contemporary narratological standpoint. More specifically, I claim that a more cautious approach to both novels' alleged âdiscursivityâ, which appears to be less reliable than commonly thought, might pave the way for an analogous metafictional reading of their entire textual structure.},

 abstract = {In Mikhail Kheraskovâs Rossiada (Rossiad), praised (for a while) as Russiaâs national epic, two characters, the mysterious hermit Vassian and the vicious sorcerer Nigrin, occupy a special place because of their capacity to do magic. This article explores whether these magi and their tricks have any historical basis â the Rossiada tells about the successful siege of Kazanâ in 1552 â and also examines the literary predecessors of the two magi have in the rich European epic tradition. Especially Tassoâs Gerusalemme liberata and its parallel plot must have been a great source of inspiration. It turns out that the presence of magic in the Rossiada has little or nothing to do with Kheraskovâs potential interest in authentic Russian magic. Actually, it was the Aristotelian poetical concept of the marvellous which the classicist poet took into account when he constructed his epic plot.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the cult of Pushkin, which was officially developed in Stalin's Russia. If many publications of that time are pure propaganda, some of them, due mainly to the âacademical Pushkinistsâ (Tomashevskii, Bondi, Tsiavlovskii, Vinokur etc.), are worth reading. However, even the most serious works could not escape a touch of Marxism. As an example, âPushkin's Historicismâ, which appeared precisely in the mid-1930s and supposed a sense of history as a result of laws and social antagonism (in the way of the new romantic historicism), could appear as the product of some ideological distortion, as Aleksandr Dolinin truly pointed it. Nevertheless, Pushkin as an historian was before largely misestimated, so the Stalin cult of Pushkin is not merely a comeback to the imperial past. In that sense, the article deals with the debate arising from David Hoffmann's book, Stalinist values: The Cultural Norms of Soviet Modernity 1917â1941 (2003), about Nicholas Timasheff's work, The Great Retreat: The Growth and Decline of Communism in Russia (1946).},

This view seems to be contrary to his later novels: in Pornography, for example, narrator Witold seems to deliver himself voluntarily to reality's chaos, and instead of creating, he is being created â by the so-called âinterhuman mechanismsâ. However, by examining Pornography more closely, I will show that the âmatureâ Gombrowicz has not given up his Ferdydurkian view at all, and that his ânewâ approach is only a smart and even necessary tactic to stay loyal to the Ferdydurkian programme. I illustrate this further by showing how Gombrowicz intelligently uses his Diary (by letting Pornography resonate in it) to maintain the difficult balance between maturity and immaturity â a balance that was of main importance in Ferdydurke.},

 abstract = {The trauma of exile affected the cultural production of the interwar Russian Ã©migrÃ© community and, like in other diasporas, honed the Ã©migrÃ©sâ attention on issues of politics, memory and (cultural) identity. Nonetheless, despite their all-dominating nature, the 1917 Revolutions and the traumatic events that followed suit never became a major topic in Russian Ã©migrÃ© literature of the time. An exception to the rule is the literary oeuvre of the largely unexplored Prague Russian Ã©migrÃ© group âSkit poetovâ (âA Hermitage of Poetsâ). The present article shortly discusses the groupâs attitude towards writing literature on the very raison dâÃªtre of life in exile and its literary practice. The main emphasis, however, lies on the analysis of two long, complex poems which were published in tandem in the journal Volia Rossii in 1928. Both poems can be called the very height of the kind of poetry the Prague literary community advocated as they not only interpret and evaluate the events of 1917 and their aftermath, but also draw a future that is a logical and inevitable continuation of the remote and recent past. Aleksei Eisnerâs âKonnitsaâ (âCavalryâ, 1928) foretells a Eurasianist future for Europe: Russians take the lead in a barbarian raid on Europe to âuncivilizeâ it, repeating past battles and sieges that were decisive for Russiaâs development. Viacheslav Lebedevâs Westernist âPoema vremennykh letâ (âPoem of Bygone Yearsâ, 1928) instead offers a Westernist future, whereby Europeanized Russian emigrants will defeat the Bolsheviks and colonize Russia with European culture.},

 abstract = {Following their conversion to Christianity in the 10th century the city Constantinople gained new religious significance for the Rus. While appearing in some earlier works, Constantinople figures prominently in several works written by Russian travelers and pilgrims between the early 13th and mid-15th centuries, that is, the period just before the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204 and its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. In addition to the insight that these works provide into medieval Russian religious belief and pilgrimage practice, the accounts left by Russian travelers and pilgrims to Constantinople also form a valuable historical source on several levels: they describe the destruction wrought on the city by the Latins in their sack of the city and subsequent rule, they provide data on the condition of the city once Byzantine rule had been re-established, and they can provide confirmation for the dating of various natural disasters and political events.},

 abstract = {Philosophical concepts are traditionally used to explain and analyse literary texts. This article tries to investigate the opposite dependency. Namely, how literary texts and characters could illustrate certain philosophical concepts while re-interpreting, extending and changing their original meaning. In KantÊ¼s context speculative (theoretical) rationality operates within strict limits: the visible tangible nature. Speculative reason may dream of overstepping the borders of nature and reaching for the invisible realm of ideas. However, for Kant, such tendencies lead to illusions and distortion of the proper working of human rationality. The extremes of speculative reason, i.e. this reasonÊ¼s hubris, and its dreams, which are unlikely to be realized, have their illustration in the strange supernatural reality described in BulgakovÊ¼s novel. This article interprets SatanÊ¼s actions in Moscow as a direct depiction of what Kant considered to be impossible: the unity of sensible nature and ideas under the rule of speculative reason.},

During the period of close contacts with Viacheslav Ivanov and poets and artists, who attended the famous Ivanov âTowerâ (the apartment, which became the Salon of Russian modernism), Kuzmin changed his appearance radically. Before the acquaintance with the poets of Ivanov's circle the Russian style was dominating in the tastes and style of Kuzmin's dress, but then that changed dramatically and Kuzmin started to wear fashionable European dress. It should be noted that the idea of Kuzmin as a dandy was based not on the facts, but on the latest memoirs of his younger contemporaries. This article is based on documentary sources: diaries and letters of Kuzmin and his views expressed in critical articles. Kuzmin himself was prone to self-reflection and evaluation of dandyism in his critical articles.},

Schon den Zeitgenossen des jungen Benua war seine retrospektive kÃ¼nstlerische Orientierung nicht verborgen geblieben. Auf dem Portrait, das Lev Bakst 1898 von dem damals 28-jÃ¤hrigen Benua anfertigte (Abbildung 6), ist das Bildnis der Kaiserin Elisabeth ein bezeichnendes Dingsymbol. Benua hatte es 1892 als zweite Arbeit Ã¼berhaupt nach einem Selbstbildnis gemalt. Diese Versenkung in Kunst und Kultur vergangener Zeiten, die am Beispiel von Versailles und Carskoe Selo erlÃ¤utert wurde, lieÎ² ihn auch an den Ausstellungen Djagilevs im Taurischen und im Grand Palais so regen Anteil nehmen. Auf Levickij, Borovikovskij, Rokotov und ihren Werken lag der Abglanz der Epoche Elisabeths und Katharinas. In der elementaren politischen und sozialen Krise unter Nikolaus II. suchte Benua Halt in einer idealisierten Vergangenheit. Er glaubte, daÎ² in wÃ¼ster Zeit der Kunst die Verzauberung der Welt obliege, und so stritt er fÃ¼r das, was in der Geschichte der menschlichen Kultur so oft ersehnt und kaum je wirklich ward: die Wiederkehr des SchÃ¶nen.},

 abstract = {The theme of this article is one to which Platonov scholars have already devoted much attention, but the study of the real-life context of PlatonovÊ¼s work reveals new aspects of this theme. The article begins with a survey of the various existing studies of the ways in which FedorovÊ¼s ideas are reflected in the âThe Foundation Pitâ. The aim of this survey is to show both what the views of other scholars have in common and how they differ. One of the most important manifestations, in âThe Foundation Pitâ, of the influence of FedorovÊ¼s ideas is the account of Voshchev collecting in his bag examples âof worn-out enduring frailtyâ. The kolkhozniks themselves end up â unexpectedly â being included in this capacity, as yet more examples of such âfrailtyâ. Reference to contemporary documents suggests that Platonov may, in this connection, have been reinterpreting FedorovÊ¼s most fundamental idea â that of âthe resurrection of the deadâ â in metaphorical terms.},

 abstract = {In this paper I focus on one of Tolstoi's marginal characters, Sonia in War and Peace. I examine Sonia's unusual narrative trajectory in the novel by comparing two key episodes â the Yuletide sequence and the epilogue. Tolstoi highlights Sonia's triumphant turn during the cross-dressing scenes only to prepare us for her eventual, and rather cruel, narrative and familial marginalization in contrast to the happily married Rostovs. While rarely studied, Sonia's narrative, I argue, is crucial to Tolstoi's overall design in War and Peace: in a novel that explicitly attacks historians as liars, Sonia's fate illustrates Tolstoi's intolerance of the historical mode of thought, what Morson terms âsemiotic totalitarianismâ. I claim that Sonia is an example of just such a thinker, and that her being, to quote Grenier, âthe (insignificant) âOtherâ squaredâ â both a woman and a member of the lower class â only aggravates this fault in Tolstoi's eyes, which results in her âpunishmentâ in the epilogue. This is the ultimate cross-dressing that is Sonia's downfall: a âmarginal womanâ, an inconsequential creature in Tolstoi's universe, she attempts to control and shape events in an authoritative âmasculineâ way that befits historians and statesmen like Napoleon, PfÃ¼hl, and Speranskii.},

 abstract = {What I term an iterative poetics characterizes much of Dmitrii Prigov's practice, from his recycling of existing texts, hackneyed quotations, and clichÃ©s, to his performance and video art, to the serial or template structure of many of his written texts and visual works. By treating these diverse strategies as part of an iterative poetics, I address three problems raised by Prigov's work and conceptual art and writing in general. First, rather than separating Prigov's literary and artistic output, I show how his work operates as a single multimedia whole founded on the principle of intra and inter-media iteration. Second, I approach the problem of whether to treat the concept or its realization as primary in conceptual works by arguing that Prigov's repetitions both stage the subordination of content to form, example to concept, and, like Gertrude Stein's âinsistences,â highlight the uniqueness of each apparent repetition within a conceptual structure, each iteration of a particular image, or each performance of a given text. Finally, I read the relationship of example to concept, text to performance, idea to instantiation in Prigov's iterative practice as an allegory for the relation of the local and the particular to wider systems of power. In this sense, Prigov's iterative poetics emphasizes both the unfreedom of endless repetition and the freedom of each gesture within the infinite possibilities of iteration.},

 abstract = {The article deals with the Russian Symbolist author and translator Liudmila Vil'kina (1873â1920). The paper discusses the theme of authority and subjectivity in her collection of sonnets Moi Sad (My Garden, 1906) in the context of West European women's writing. Vil'kina's poetry contains topics current in the feminist thought of the beginning of the 20th century. One of them is the question about the language which both enables and hinders the construction of subjectivity. Vil'kina's poetry can be read as a part of the path-breaking fictional work which preceded the emergence of the postmodern (feminist) philosophy of (female) subjectivity.},

 abstract = {The military efforts during the Napoleonic Wars gave rise to a large-scale cartographic enterprise across the European continent. As a medium of war, military maps served the purpose of orchestrating the âgrand operationsâ of several distinct army corps in space. After the wars, however, the maps migrate into a different medium: the literary text. This article examines how Tolstoi's War and Peace grapples with a central problem for the 19th century novel, viz. the role of different media, literary and cartographic, in the representation and management of large-scale war. Tolstoi, the author argues, transposes the military conflict to the representational level and stages a struggle between the two media and the different military theories of the time that accompany them. Operating at this meta-level, War and Peace serves as a highly complex and self-conscious examination of the media of war.},

@article{EPTJN2011393,
 abstract = {This article outlines the projective approach to the Russian language in its distinction from âobjectiveâ and ânormativeâ approaches (as formulated by A.A. Peshkovskii). The contemporary state of the Russian language is characterized by the abundance of borrowings (predominantly from English) and lack of verbal creativity on the basis of vernacular roots. Is it possible to revive the potential of the language and to enact new formative processes that expand the lexical and conceptual power of Russian? Referring to Velimir KhlebnikovÊ¼s example, the author shows that neologisms are not deviations but most authentic manifestations of the language system. To produce new words means to systematize the process of word-formation, to make it more regular. As Grigory Vinokur has shown, Russian language is deficient in regular models of word derivation and has not yet employed its potential for systematicity on both lexical and morphological levels. Thus the innovative approach to language that was initiated by Russian futurists and formalists needs continuation today, not only in poetry or fiction, but on the scale of language as such. V. Khlebnikov called it âiazykovodstvoâ (linguistry, cf. âforestryâ), whereas G. Vinokur stressed the need for âlinguistic engineeringâ. The article introduces the concept of âsuper-rowsâ, or âhyper-paradigmsâ, the lexical clusters that include both actual and potential words and thus demonstrate the creative potential of the language. The famous Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian Language by Vladimir DalÊ¼ in fact combines the features of a descriptive and projective dictionary as it includes in its entries both existing lexical units and those that illustrate the formative power of the morphological system. The impact of DalÊ¼s Dictionary on A. Belyi, V. Khlebnikov and other avant-garde writers can be explained by its constructive and imaginative approach to language which is rather unusual for lexicography. Projective linguistics is meant to become an application of linguistic theory to practical transformation of language aimed at the increasing implementation of its creative potentials.},

To show this mechanism, two poems of Kharms are analyzed, dedicated to his friends and fellow-poets A. Vvedenskii and N. Zabolotskii. The aim of the article is to find the rules of interpretation that help to determine both the individual Kharmsian deviations and the more general artistic principles of the OBERIU group. Particular attention is paid to the violation of the syntactic rules concerning the combination of primary and secondary predicates, which create unusual ways of switching from one semantic space to another. At the same time, irregular verb constructions show us some kind of play with the splitting up of the âIâ.},

We analyse three early poems by Aigi â âSuddenly â a flashing holidayâ, âYou from the endâ, âTo you from the endâ (1963â1964) in which the change of subjective perspective creates an oscillating effect of explicitness/implicitness of the lyrical subject and, accordingly, of the addressee. The analysis of three poems shows that the addressee âYouâ to whom the poet refers consists in samomysl' (self-thought) or in God, gifting the âIâ with this thought. This means that the subject in Aigi's poetry â being formally manifested or not â always coexists with a certain Divine Principle that assumes either a male or female form.},

 abstract = {Recently, the âlyric subjectâ has become a problematic category: it has ceased to be taken as an integral bearer of consciousness and speech and has begun to be perceived as a construct that is modelled in the text and does not exist outside the scope of the text. A notable characteristic of recent poetry is that the subject of the text becomes âsplitâ into the âWriting Selfâ that generates the direct speech structure of the text and the âOther Selfâ that acts as a reflective instance in relation to the former. Applying Jacques Lacanâs âsplit subjectâ concept to the analysis of contemporary poetic texts, we identify a range of creative and communicative strategies through which the subject finds its reflexive origin in the text. These strategies are as follows: a metalinguistic, intertextual, or removal and dismissal strategy; a role-playing strategy; and a bodily strategy. These strategies change and alternate in a given authorâs texts as well as interact and overlap with each other, creating a more complex system of dependencies within the âsplitâ subject.},

According to Tolstoi, the farther man is from dog in his eating habits, the more human he is. Bulgakov ironically tests this concept: the process of Sharik's (the dog's) transformation into a quasi-human starts with feeding him human food, which was inaccessible to most humans after the revolution. Throughout the novella, Sharik is both nourished by benevolent cooks and metaphorically cooked by evil cooks, but he never becomes truly human. This dialogue with Tolstoi serves as a catalyst for Bulgakov's evaluation of the prominent definitions of humanism â those posed by Darwin, Marx, and Aristotle.},

Whereas in the micro-novel âPismo w stronÄ miÅoÅciâ (âWriting Towards Loveâ, 1999) Pankowski brackets off and then deconstructs common ways of speaking and writing about elderly love and the ageing body, the more recent Bal wdÃ³w i wdowcÃ³w (The WidowsÊ¼ and WidowersÊ¼ Ball, 2006) constructs a completely new language (that differs from sentimental speech and refrains from withdrawing into the past tense). By doing so, the author regains speech, time and space for issues that so far have remained on the cultural margins. As such, Pankowski is an exponent of the sensu stricto modernist willingness to widen the borders of reality by means of artistic creation.},

 abstract = {Within the extensive context of Russian cultural and poetic experiments, the figure of Velimir Khlebnikov stands out as evidence of the utmost coherence of creative principles manifested in his writings and the ideology of his everyday life, realized through an adventurous program of language policies in his oeuvre. It is this linguistic challenge of the Futurian that has inspired discussion from his first academic critics (B. Bukhshtab, V. Gofman, R. Jakobson, G. Vinokur) up to the present. However, the issue of how KhlebnikovÊ¼s âlanguage husbandryâ (âiazykovodstvoâ, a term coined by the poet himself) relates to and coheres with his own life behavior, has yet to be investigated. In this study I propose to give a sketch of the poetÊ¼s philosophy of language and then relate it to the idea of life-creation. KhlebnikovÊ¼s experimentation in language creativity is viewed here in close relation to the substantial dimension of his linguistic research. This is to demonstrate that language, for him, is not only a means of artistic play, but also a way of transforming consciousness. Moreover, language is a tool for transforming reality (cf. his statement âSlovo upravliaet mozgom, mozg â rukami, ruki â tsarstvamiâ (âThe word rules the brain, the brain rules the hands, the hands rule the realmsâ). The aim of this article is to bridge KhlebnikovÊ¼s philosophy of language and the ideas he implemented in his life behavior. The concept of âbreakthrough into languagesâ (âproryv v iazykiâ), used in his later poem âThe Scratch across the Skyâ is analyzed in this paper as the constituent metaphor defining his poetic strategies and the elements of his life-creation.},

 abstract = {The present essay addresses the âzeroâ symbolism in the Russian avant-garde's discourse, unparalleled in other 20th century avant-gardes, that includes, besides contributions by Malevich and Kruchenykh, ideas and images created by Andrei Belyi and interpretive involvement of Roman Jakobson. This discussion leads to the illumination of the place that Kruchenykh's libretto for Victory over the Sun occupies in the international avant-garde's topos of the symbolic attack on the natural sources of light â the moon and the sun. This âonslaught on the luminariesâ is expressed by what is identified in the essay as the âavant-garde gestureâ of aesthetic defiance, traceable in the international avant-garde from Marinetti to Jean-Luc Godard.},

@article{FISHZON2018167,
 abstract = {The article takes its basis in D.W. Winnicottâs theories of play and transitional space to argue that Stagnation-era sound recordings and animated films found a devoted audience of both adults and children because, like Winnicottâs good-enough mother or therapist, they created the conditions for playing: they did not merely narrate play, but also embodied, invited, and enacted it. Fishzon looks closely at the performative and analytic functions of Vladimir Vysotskiiâs popular musical adaptation of Alisa v strane chudes (Alice in Wonderland, 1977), which employed and served as a play framework or analytic session. Vysotskiiâs broadly circulated, well-known work enabled Brezhnev-era citizens to dream a new habitus and ideology at a time when irony and playing were becoming increasingly difficult. While opportunities for paradox narrowed in Soviet official discourse and printed fiction after the Thaw, childrenâs records and animated films shaped critical imaginations and made space for subjectivity.},

@article{FIUT2007433,
 abstract = {The paper focuses on Witold Gombrowicz's interpretation of the postcolonial discourse that was taking shape during his years in Argentina. In the Diaries he unmasked the ideological foundations of this discourse. On the one hand, he criticized the very simplistic application by some of its participants of the doctrine of communism, which tends to attribute all evil in the world to Western capitalism, particularly practised by the United States, while on the other hand he voiced objections to the Latin American nativism and nationalism, both engendered, in his view, by an inferiority complex. An emphasis on the language of the body as an interpretational tool in defining the nature of the Latin American identity is a particularly valuable insight on Gombrowicz's part. Ultimately, he opposed the essence-oriented approach to the question of national character and suggested instead an interpersonalist and activist view which, despite traditional forms and stereotypes, emphasizes the need for continual personal and socially oriented self-recreation.},

 abstract = {In music histories, Emil Medtner has been overlooked almost completely, as well as the Germanophile cultural tendencies he represented. His severe criticism of âmodernistâ trends in music and his frankly exposed racist and anti-Semite worldview have made him a sort of bÃªte noire for musicologists. A closer look on his writings reveals many contradictions and ambiguities in his judgements. Taking Liszt and Rachmaninov as examples, it becomes evident that Medtner's attitude towards music and his distinction between performers and composers, as compared to his own brother Nikolai, was based on culturological and ultimately racist ideologies.},

However, apart from being a poet, Khlebnikov had a rationalistic, scientific point of view, and for that reason could not and would not always avoid western words, nor deny the leading role of the West in scientific progress. One cannot call Khlebnikov simply anti-western, as he also integrates the West in his Khlebnikovian poetics.},

The futurist theory of âtransnational languageâ builds on the link between magical glossolalic speech and poetic language. Neo-avant-garde Russian poetry sees the rebirth of verbal mysticism. The idea of glossolalic incantation enters the poetry of G. Aigi and E.Â Mnatsakanowa. Belyiâs âdark glossolaliaâ adopts the force of sorcery in these poetic works.},

Non-binary gender identities are contextualized by the co-relation between sex/gender, gender self-representation (gender expression), and sexual and romantic attraction, which implicate various combinations of masculinity and femininity as they define the identity of the lyrical subject. The paper discusses several non-binary identities such as the polygender homosexual lyrical subject (Gila Loran, Iashka Kazanova), androgynous bisexual subject (Nailia Iamakova), and the agender asexual subject (Marianna Geide).},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to define the specific, culturally meaningful situation of the not very well-known poet Valentin Annenskii-Krivich (1880â1936), the son of Innokentii Annenskii. KrivichÊ¼s poetry can be studied for its âindividual poetic style of a little-known authorâ, but also for questions such as celebrity and obscurity, the role of family relationship, literary heritage, originality and imitation. The article concentrates on the composition, motifs and stylistic devices of KrivichÊ¼s anthology Flowers and Grass (Tsvetotravy, 1912). The analysis of the poem âFrom thereâ (âOttudaâ) reveals that deliberate and explicit imitation of Annenskii allowed Krivich to create one of his best and most original works.},

 abstract = {Chzhungo means âChinaâ in Chinese, and Tretâiakovâs book by this unusual title was the outcome of his living and teaching in Peking during 1924 and 1925. It was first published in 1927. A second revised and amplified edition came out in 1930, but after the authorâs execution in 1937 his books disappeared from Soviet libraries. Very few copies of either edition of Chzhungo reached libraries outside Russia. As the editors of the partial re-editions of works by Tretâiakov after his posthumous ârehabilitationâ decided not to bring Chzhungo back into circulation, it remains unavailable in print. This article offers an introduction to the book. Referring to the second edition, the author analyses the self-positioning of Tretâiakov as an involved observer of Chinese life and political awakening; the image of China that emerges from Chzhungo; and the status of Chzhungo within the larger context of Tretâiakovâs work.},

 abstract = {This article examines the use of central perspective in photography during the time of industrialisation and collectivisation, and how perspective symbolically affects the intrinsic subject function and various representational effects. The author argues that perspective and its symbolic potential 1. impacted substantially on the Soviet-era mediascape and 2. gave effect to the concept of the liberated worker in control of the means of production. Taking a typical motif from this time, the âploughed fieldâ, the author examines how the perspective dispositif structurally constitutes the subject. Central perspective, criticized by the artistic avant-garde during the 1920s, was put to new use in the propaganda journal SSSR na Stroike (USSR in Construction). The subject function of central perspective was reflexively challenged and defamiliarized, indicating the displacement and dissolution of the subjectâs agency into the immanence of the material-economic production process. In the course of the 1930s, central perspective hardened unevenly into classical representational structures â a process that has left traces in present-day media and politico-economic developments.},

 abstract = {The Latin epigraph to F.I. Tiutchev's poem âPÐµvuchÐµst' Ðµst' v mÐ¾rskikh volnakhâ¦â (1865) is known as a version of a poetic line which belongs to the Roman poet Decimus Magnus Ausonius (310â394). This paper proposes a hypothesis which explains why the name of Ausonius does not appear under the epigraph. It shows how certain words within the epigraph, and some poetic techniques associated with the name of its author, as well as his name as such, strongly influence the text of Tiutchev's poem on various levels. Ausonius's experiments, and the exploration of such compositional devices as anagram, acrostic, telestic, and mesostic happen to affect Tiutchev's poetic technique, especially in the rhymes and in the final stanza. In the light of this study it becomes clear that the tradition of publishing just three out of the four stanzas may be harmful to both the poem's composition and its meaning.},

Pumpianskii in Derzhavin's ode âOn the Death of Prince Meshcherskiiâ. The main goal of this paper is to reevaluate Tiutchev's poem (B2) entitled âInsomnia: The Night's Passing Momentâ. B2 is shown to be a variation on the most famous early poem B1, whose main theme, lexicon, rhyme vowel structure and a system of vowel sound repetition (assonance) are explored in B2. Many features of B2 prove the novelty of its genre and composition. Tiutchev's poem B2 turns out to belong to so-called âsuggestiveâ poetry. Within the synaesthetic composition of B2, there are four parallel lines of images (temporal, spacial, auditory, and visual). The three-part composition of B2 is built similarly to a musical form; its focus on the vowel repetition in the sound texture indicates the âmusicalityâ of Tiutchev's late poem (the most characteristic feature of suggestive lyrics).},

 abstract = {Aigi operates in his poetics with a latent transnationalism and translingual techniques. The relevant topic of his poems is not the ambivalence of cultural, national and linguistic allegiance, but rather the poetic implementation of linguistic hybridization. References to the Chuvash language as well as to the Chuvash cultural and spiritual heritage are but occasional in his texts, remaining in subtitles or dedications, as several examples show. Innovative instability is manifested in the significant occurrence of the border as a semantic dominant, or as a metaphor of hieroglyphics and extreme types of articulation (scream). Aigi's radical transnational and translingual approach conceptualizes not (only) the author's cultural biography, but, first of all, the borders and limits of (any) language.},

 abstract = {Boris Eikhenbaumâs 1927 essay on the literary environment (literaturnyi byt) marks an important conceptual turning point in the formalist approach to the study of literature, shifting the focus from immanent analysis of the text to what he called âliteratureâs social mode of being.â This article revisits Eikhenbaumâs approach as a point of departure for the study of late socialist literature. It explores literary periodicals in the 1960s through the lens of a bibliographical dataset which was developed as part of the digital humanities project Soviet Journals Reconnected.11The digital humanities project Soviet Journals Reconnected was developed during a year-long fellowship at the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton and I am indebted to Natalia Ermolaev, Jean Bauer, Miranda Marraccini, Tom Mazanec, and Claude Willan for their support and feedback. I would like to thank Marijeta Bozovic for including me in this special issue and the two anonymous reviewers from Russian Literature for their suggestions. This project was made possible by Indiana University Libraryâs generous agreement to share the raw data of the digitized âLetopisâ zhurnalânykh stateiâ. Applied to this data, quantitative methods reveal the emergence of centrifugal forces and a fragmented mode of literary production during this period. By providing a detailed discussion and documentation of computational methods and putting them into a dialogue with studies of the literary environment in the vein of Eikhenbaum, this article highlights the connections and potential research uses of digital humanities approaches for the Slavic field.},

Sabashnikovaa, published in the present issue. Ideas that lived within the publishing house âMusagetâ, including that of the Rosicrucian brotherhood, which A. Mintslova wished to establish, based on Steiner's theosophy, are briefly discussed. Mintslova had acquainted Sabashnikova with Medtner in 1910 and promised him that Steiner would heal his psychological and physical ailments. Later Medtner found his healing in Jungian psychoanalysis. The correspondence covers the period of 1911â1913, which passed for them under the sign of Steiner's Theosophy.},

 abstract = {Three significant books that deal with Prague are used as gateways to literary thoughts about this ancient city at the center of Europe. Short glances at the city's history are followed by two figures directly related to the nature of Prague, Franz Kafka and Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek, whose tragic visions alternate and often merge with raucous laughter. This leads to the complex Czech-German relations that have been haunting, but also enriching the city's culture. Returning to literature, this study briefly explores works (banned during the Communist regime) where Prague appears filtered through the intellects and perceptions of three very different Czech writers (KlÃ­ma, Kundera, VaculÃ­k). Subsequently, the vision expands to the enormous impact Prague has had on internationally well-known writers (Apollinaire, Banville, Beckett, Rilke, Trollope). Ultimately, this essay seeks to highlight the opposites which Prague comprises â its ancient nature as it constantly renews itself, its tragic periods shot through with lively irony, its jostling because of political changes and finally, its perennially being steeped in a specific magic which writers of different cultures have long been trying to describe.},

Next, the article discusses the problem of sincerity in Ryzhii's poetry, including the problem of the lyrical hero. Finally, in a thorough analysis of the poem âElegiiaâ (âElegyâ) the devices are shown by which Ryzhii succeeds in reinventing the poetic resources of sincerity and leaves his âhuman markâ in his work.},

 abstract = {This article examines the dialogic relationship between youth subcultures and official discourse in the postwar Soviet Union. I argue that this relationship produced the conceptual categories that later allowed dissidents like Vasilii Aksenov to articulate positions of dissent. First, I trace how the stiliagi â a stylish urban subculture of the 1940s and 1950s â forged non-discursive identities through material and performative practices, which avoided ideological definitions. Next, I examine the reaction to the stiliagi in the official press, as it sought to interpret the youth within prescribed discursive categories. Finally, I turn to Aksenov, whose fiction often dramatizes the conflict between youth behaviors and official discourse. I suggest that in his fiction, Aksenov developed a strategy for youth self-interpretation which repurposed the categories of official discourse, and reframed apolitical outsider status as an articulate form of dissent.},

The author explores the evolution of the interpretation strategies of the criticism in âthickâ magazines as reflecting the search for a new identity. Metacriticism shows a transition from âunmaskingâ strategies to the construction of new principles of interpretation of texts. Socially oriented criticism shows a move from a ârestorativeâ to a âcorrectiveâ and then to an âanalyticalâ strategy. Interpretation of art and literature in criticism is determined by the question âwhat are the ways of the survival/existence of literature in the situation of crisis and the end?â Literary-critical reception as a reply, in correlation with one's own worldview, takes the form of self-interpretation, which is complicated by an appeal to ontological and existential questions.},

 abstract = {Although ageing has become an important issue in the arts and humanities, there is a striking lack of coverage of old age and ageing as represented in Russian literature. This paper highlights a theme constantly recurring in Russian narratives of ageing: the memory of the past and a witness's testimony as constitutive of the identity of the narrated self. The article provides analyses of 20th-century Russian women's prose in which memory and testimony play a decisive role for the ageing protagonist and her sense of self. Drawing on Paul RicÅur's concept of ânarrative identityâ, this paper aims to show that, in these texts, age identity is constructed around the notion of âhaving remained the sameâ and that this, notably, applies to the intersection of ageing and gender.},

It criticizes the contemporary neurological negation of notions such as âmindâ, âconsciousnessâ and âsoulâ, and explores the concept of self-consciousness in BelyiÊ¼s poem âSamosoznanieâ. It argues that, by implying knowledge of the world and the self, BelyiÊ¼s understanding of â(samo-)soznanieâ aims at a certain verbal and semantic completeness, or even integrity, which is considered an analogue of BakhtinÊ¼s term âso-bytieâ, meaning the âbeing-togetherâ of Self and Other in the event. BakhtinÊ¼s concept rejects the romantic philosophical idea of an all-embracing autonomous subject from the viewpoint of philosophical pragmatism in an avant-garde world. BelyiÊ¼s axiological model of an evolving self-consciousness of culture in the Self repudiates Cartesian philosophy as âculturosophyâ together with its positivist model of the world (which implies a Self separated from the world). In this way, the modes of thinking observed in Belyi and Bakhtin are complementary to each other.},

 abstract = {Though the word âteloâ (âbodyâ) is used in Aigi's poetry with falling frequency, the motif of âbodyâ is a relevant issue of his poetic works. Aigi himself spoke about the âBody of Literature, the Flesh of Poetryâ. Firstly, the article considers the relation of Aigi's poetic concept of the body to the development of similar notions from ancient to contemporary philosophy (Bakhtin, Nancy, Tul'chinskii, Epshtein) and discusses the openness of the body in his work to its immediate surrounding as well as to the universe. Secondly, the article traces the development of this entity and shows how in Aigi's texts the phenomenon of body is supplemented with its opposite, with bodilessness, and thÐµreby transferred into a metaphysical sphere: the body is at the same time the property and the creative task of its owner. The frequent words âpoleâ (âfieldâ as body of the world), âbelyiâ (âwhiteâ as purification) and the less frequent expression âRussiaâ (as a field) are considered in their relation to Aigi's poetic concept of body. Bodilessness corresponds to emptiness and silence, the world (dis)appears as the body of God. Lastly, the article shows how Aigi uses his name and its components as bodies of a poetic text, as in the epic âLast Exitâ about the Nazi Holocaust and Soviet totalitarianism.},

 abstract = {This article constructs a typology of the poetic subject in the poetry of Gennadii Aigi, with a focus on address in lyric communication. It first distinguishes the poetic ego (the speaking entity) from the poetic subject and correlates the latter with the concept of the reader/addressee. While the poetic ego is verbally and poetically expressed in the text, the poetic subject is merely implied and must be reconstructed by the reader as the entity responsible for the poetically and verbally expressed text. This article suggests a fivefold typology of poetic subjects in Aigiâs poetry: 1) a referential subject that is dominated by the relation of itself to the world; 2) an âaddressiveâ subject that is governed by its relation to the addressee; 3) a subject determined by its relation to the verbal and poetic tropes used and/or thematized in the poem; 4) a highly hybrid subject that is characterized by cross-referencing literary and cultural media; and 5) a subject that performs a religious syncretism by which a new kind of psalmody is achieved. This typology enables us to bring the variety of Aigiâs texts into a systematic relation with the concept of the poetic subject.},

Earlier analyses have revealed themes and scenes in the novel that may be read as conscious attempts to commemorate Tsvetaeva and the special relation Pasternak had to her. However, little attention has been paid in the context of the Tsvetaeva connection to Zhivago's poems. Joseph Brodsky noted echoes of Tsvetaeva in âMagdalinaâ (âMary Magdaleneâ), but the multivalent status of Zhivago's poems seems to have made researchers hesitant to follow this lead. However, the poems in the novel deserve to be read as having been written precisely from this position: from within a fiction â but a fiction created for very specific artistic reasons. By presenting the poems in this way, Pasternak managed to contextualize his poetic expression in a way that was congenial to his personal relationship with Tsvetaeva and the artistic worldview which he shared with her, and which both regarded as a common heritage received from Rilke.},

Nevertheless, the mail art community is constituted by certain mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. Thus, on one level, economical and political factors are limitations, which make joining the network difficult and sometimes impossible for artists in poor countries or in countries with a totalitarian regime. On another level, an artist's belonging to the network community relies on how well he or she recognizes and (re-)produces recognizable signs of subjectivity. This âsubjectivityâ takes the form of signs of authenticity and internal memory, which are used and reused by its participants and, thereby, create a certain communicative language within a group. More than any of the Soviet artists who have been participating in the network, Rea Nikonova and Serge Segay achieved some success in becoming a part of the mail art community. This success relied on how well the artists performed according to the rules by which the network works.},

 abstract = {This paper compares and contrasts dystopian counterfactual thought experiments in Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) on the one hand and the utopian vision of the future in Chernyshevskii's novel What Is to Be Done? (1863) on the other hand. Chernyshevskii's future forecast appears in Vera Pavlovna's fourth dream (Chapter XVI) and arguably constitutes Russia's answer to Malthusian theories, an interpretation that is supported by the novelist's critical writings. Malthus' vision of the future is based on the assumption that a constant struggle for existence between individuals is inevitable within human society: he believes that there will always be a shortage of food and other natural resources, since population grows much faster than food production. With reference to closely related theories by Darwin and Kropotkin, the present article argues that for ÄernyÅ¡evskij, in contrast, one of the most fundamental principles underlying interpersonal relations is mutual help, which leads to cooperation and teamwork for the sake of the common good. The method used for this analysis is interdisciplinary, combining critical tools from the disciplines of literary studies and philosophy. While numerous studies have been devoted to Vera Pavlovna's fourth dream, the novelty of the above approach lies in reappraising this famous chapter by reading it as a thought experiment. This experiment plays through the Malthusian scenario of population growth and results in a completely different outcome. Such an analysis sheds light both on Chernyshevskii's model of the future and on the epistemic value of literary thought experiments within a wider cultural and scholarly context.},

 abstract = {In past and present criticism, a fundamental debate hinges on the precise nature of Dostoevskii's Christianity. Is he an advocate of 19th-century institutional Orthodoxy, or does his Orthodox discourse surpass the ecclesiastical programme? This article explores a subtle theological subtext in Dostoevskii's short story âSon smeshnogo chelovekaâ (âThe Dream of a Ridiculous Manâ, 1877). More specifically, I excavate in the tale three traditions of Byzantine and Old Russian Orthodoxy (apophaticism, kenoticism and iurodstvo) that were silenced in the 19th-century official Church, thereby showing how the text directs towards a revival of this lost heritage in Russian Orthodoxy.},

 abstract = {Already since the publication of Fedor Dostoevskii's The Brothers Karamazov (1879â1880), one of the characters that has been arousing much controversy is the starets or elder Zosima. In spite of the writer's intention to create in Zosima a âpure, ideal Christianâ, the starets stirred up divided opinions in Russian ecclesiastical circles. In this paper, I aim to show that in his fictional elder Dostoevskii resuscitated a medieval tradition of contemplative monasticism and related spirituality, which was gradually pushed into the margins of the Russian church. More specifically, it will be revealed that in Zosima Dostoevskii recreated some echoes of the teachings of the 15th century monk Nil Sorskii, or Nil of Sora (1433â1508), who was the first to develop and write down a Russian theology of hesychasm.},

 abstract = {This paper examines contemporary poetic texts in which the lyric subject (âspeakerâ) is demonstrably presented in a degraded manner. The lack of indicators of ironic distance makes it easy for the reader to project this lower status from the subject onto the author, which appears to compromise the artist on an evaluative scale and his/her entitlement to produce âcultural textsâ. This paper offers a survey of the most common methods by which the degradation of the subject is performed: violation of poetic norms; simulation of language and thought pathology; as well as metapoetic commentary. Finally, the paper discusses the question of function, and argues that through such a paradoxical strategy, the poet provokes the reader into moving beyond the textual frames, with the result that the author himself or herself is drawn into the space of the artistic work.},

 abstract = {This article juxtaposes the concepts of myth and discourse as in-principle alternative cultural strategies, which, however, in most cases in cultural practice are combined as hybrids with each other. Neo-myths differ from the so-called âprimitiveâ myths, which do not imply their discursive background, by the fact, that they do imply or show opposition to discourse at the same time asdiscourses imply or show their opposition to (neo-)myths. Neo-myths also imply processes of de-mythologisation and re-mythologisation. How (neo-) myths and discourses work is analyzed using the examples of (1) the topical myth of the World-Egg, which is at the same time the (discursive) state of zero in a drawing of Daniil Kharms, (2) the âchronicalâ neo-myth of Khlebnikovâs Tables of Destiny, and (3) Rozanovâs personal neo-myth of Ancient Egypt Reborn with its negation of hieroglyphic texts, in the first half of the 20th century and (4) Kabakovâs recent neo-myth of the Concerto for Fly with its new relation between human (as part of culture) and animal (as part of nature) and (5) of the neo-myth The Love for Three Zuckerbrins in Pelevinâs recent eponymous anti-utopian novel. The article reconstructs the development of the correlation between neo-myth and discourse in recent Russian culture in the context of the use of different, in most cases verbal and pictorial, media.},

 abstract = {The Socialist Realist production novel of the Stalin period does not deal with the problem of money, though it played an enormous role as a mechanism of compensation for the shortcomings of the Soviet planned economy. Only satirical authors focussed on the âsmall worldâ in which people were preoccupied by the question how to survive in hard times. Texts like IlÊ¼f and PetrovÊ¼s The Golden Calf, ZoshchenkoÊ¼s Blue Book and BulgakovÊ¼s The Master and Margarita focus on different aspects of the matter. IlÊ¼f and PetrovÊ¼s anarchist trickster hero Ostap Bender entertains his readers by his adventures bordering on mimicry and provocation. Zoshchenko aims at a didactical treatment of the problem but his amusing and âbarbarousâ stories rather give evidence of the fact that money continues to spoil the human character even in Soviet times. BulgakovÊ¼s unmasking of the behavior of the Moscow population results in the insight that striving for money seems to be an ineradicable human quality. One can understand why money is a subversive topic in Soviet literature.},

Later on, one could observe an expansion into the fields of philosophy, mythopoetics, comparativism and anthropology.

 abstract = {The introduction to Velimir Khlebnikov's late cosmological magnum opus Doski Sud'by (Tables of Fate) traces the genesis of the work from its 1905 inception, when Khlebnikov set himself the task of finding the laws of time, to his premature death in 1922. The essay presents an overview of the archival materials and their publishing history; it considers the most pertinent questions of textual arrangement and stylistic characteristics; it introduces the fundamentals of Khlebnikov's cosmological theory as well as his vision of the future; it also includes a discussion of editorial issues pertinent for this version of Khlebnikov's modernist epic.},

 abstract = {V. Summary
Starting from a special sentence-conception (De Groot) and from the idea of âstratificationâ of the language utterance (Ingarden) we have tried to investigate a grammatical category, viz., that of the viewpoint. To this end realizations of this category in the various strata were considered; the psychological subject and predicate (intonation, word order) diathesis (activum/passivum), division into main sentences and subordinate clauses, the differences between the grammatical persons, differences between pronomina such as âhereâ and âthereâ, âthisâ and âthatâ, the differences between the parts of speech and lexemes as âlargeâ and ânot smallâ. In a text beyond one sentence we tried to connect these realizations with the point de vue. A viewpoint is considered a concomitant factor of a dicendi field. Characters not uttering dicendi fields do not present viewpoints. The viewpoints may be supported by observandi constructions. After that the point de vue was compared to the handling of a moviecamera. Hereby the following facets were distinguished: the person who handles the camera (dicendi field structure), the kind of camera apparatus used (filter), which is at the verge of the viewpoint and is a kind of device (âmaking it strangeâ), the âposition and the direction of the shots of the cameraâ, with which is connected the choice of personalia (I, you, he) and demonstrative indications such as âhereâ and âthereâ, âdistanceâ, âexposureâ, and picture frequency, which are connected with bringing into the fore and pushing into the background elements of content such as personages and objects, in the simple sentence corresponding with psychologic subject and predicate, the division into main sentences and subordinate clauses.},

 abstract = {This article focuses on some of the central issues raised by Achmatova's later work â including her unconventional use of the poetic persona â through the prism of her well-known elegy âMenja, kak rekuâ. This lyric can be seen to manifest a peculiarly postmodernist sensibility when viewed in the light of certain theoretical constructions of postmodernism. The argument draws on the work of the American theorist Brian McHale, who finds that postmodernist writing is characterised by a concern with ontology, in that it offers imaginative constructions of different possible worlds and thus confronts out world with other worlds that lie adjacent or parallel to it. This model of postmodernism aids and interpretation of Achmatova's elegy, in which she meditates on historical disjunction and writes her own alternate-world story by exploring the memory of that which has not happened. This understanding of âMenja, kak rekuâ in turn sheds light on Achmatova's later period more generally: the projection of different orders of being is a prevalent device, closely related to Achmatova's sense of living a âposthumousâ existence.},

@article{HARVEY2007293,
 abstract = {During his five-month stay in the United States from March to August 1931, Boris Pil'niak became acquainted with several significant American writers: Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Floyd Dell, Regina Andrews, Waldo Frank, Mike Gold, Max Eastman, W.E. Woodward, and Upton Sinclair. These encounters are important for at least two reasons. First, Pil'niak's impressions of these writers reflect the Soviet debates during the early 1930s about literature's social commission and about the virtues and shortcomings of American literature as a model for Russian literature in this regard. Second, when viewed in the context of the growing schism in the American socialist and communist movement, the controversy over Max Eastman's assessment of Pil'niak and the Soviet writer's response, which appeared in Modern Monthly, New Masses, and Partisan Review, it becomes clear that Pil'niak found himself caught in the crossfire of the American literary and political polemics of the day. Within the emissary-like context of his trip, I argue that not only were certain Soviet authors âartists in uniformâ, so also were many of their American counterparts. While the body of Pil'niak's travel memoirs is large and multifaceted, this article focuses specifically on his experiences with American writers, based on an analysis of heretofore unutilized archival sources in the United States about his trip and on his travelogue Okay: An American Novel.},

Allusions to the supernatural accentuate and then subvert the hunter-narrator's sense of the Russian people as an exotic other. This reading is supported by an analysis of a hitherto-unexplored link between âBezhin lugâ and one of Gogol's stories from the Vechera na khutore bliz Dikan'ki. There has been much written about the positive influence of Gogol' on the author of the Zapiski okhotnika; but Turgenev's references to âSorochinskaia iarmarkaâ make it clear that he is taking his mentor as a negative example. His use of the supernatural to accentuate the peasants' humanity contrasts with its application by Gogol' for precisely the opposite aim.},

The novella is riddled with dissembling and play-acting. Tolstoi worries that constantly performing for audiences causes the modern subject to lose track of its true desires, which renders us incapable of authentic being, makes us effectively identical to one another and hence anonymous, interchangeable, and incapable of love, and dooms us to misery as we begin to act exclusively on role-played, rather than real, impulses. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the hero and the text are unable to escape theatricality themselves Such a reading has the virtue of being able to make sense of a number of puzzling twists in the plot that till now have been problematic or inexplicable.},

Tretâiakovâs reports on China in Chzhungo (1927, second edition 1930) analyses his future-oriented ethnography and his perspective of reversal that aims at the theatralisation of reality. He tried to integrate the effect of a dramatised trial into his judgmental, journalistic prose. Inspired by Chinese theatre as a source for avant-garde aesthetics, Tretâiakov presents China as a stage and likely borrows the idea of standardising new role models from Chinese theatre, which constitutes not only one of the shifts from old to new that he documents, but also an instrument and symbol of Tretâiakovâs participant observation project. Oscillating between journalist and poet, Tretâiakov develops intergeneric journalism into a new form of literature.},

@article{HOLLAND2007175,
 abstract = {This essay examines the importance of the novels of George Sand as literary models for Alexander and Natalie Herzen's accounts of their family drama. Kate Holland explores the multiple contexts of the Herzens' readings of Sand, demonstrating how her novels helped them to interpret the emotional, political, social and historical significance of their own experiences of triangular desire. Holland's close analysis of Natalie's letters to Herwegh during the period of their affair reveals how Natalie's experience of triangular desire was mediated by the social, political and hermeneutic structures of Sand's novels Consuelo (1842â1843), La Comtesse de Rudolstadt (1844) and La Petite Fadette (1848). Inspired by her reading of Sand, Natalie confers symbolic value on her relationship with Herwegh, recasting her affair as a fantasy of overcoming the social and political differences which have been revealed in the 1848 revolution. Holland's discussion of Herzen's work on Part Five of My Past and Thoughts (Byloe i dumy) and his letters of the time shows how his account of his wife's affair borrows from Sand's Horace (1834) as it seeks to represent Herwegh as a bourgeois historical villain, guilty both of the seduction of Natalie and the failure of the 1848 revolution.},

 abstract = {This article argues that PlatonovÊ¼s relationship to collective authorship is a rich and productive line of inquiry for Platonov studies because: 1) he spent much of his career negotiating his position vis-Ã -vis the theory and practices of literary collectives; and 2) this approach offers insight into texts that were produced specifically for collectively authored volumes or republished in them during PlatonovÊ¼s lifetime. The article then presents readings of two such texts, âTakyrâ and âOdukhotvorennye liudiâ, against the collectively authored volumes in which they appeared, Aiding-Giunler: AlÊ¼manakh k desiatiletiiu Turkmenistana, 1924â1934 (1934) and Stalinskoe plemia (1944). Ultimately the article suggests that when these so-called âsocialist realistâ texts are read synchronically, rather than just diachronically against the wholes of PlatonovÊ¼s oeuvre or the Russian canon, they take on extra life, as the uniqueness of PlatonovÊ¼s voice within the collective emerges.},

@article{HOLY201535,
 abstract = {The aim of this article is to present a concise insight into the Shoah topics in Czech literature. The images of the Shoah went through various phases within Czech literature. Immediately after World War II, it primarily centered on documentary accounts of those who had lived through Nazi camps (The Death Factory by Ota Kraus and Erich SchÃ¶n/Kulka about Auschwitz). JiÅÃ­ Weil's novel Life with a Star (1949) not only presented the horrible brutality of the Shoah, but also its seemingly banal, even profane side. This novel is considered the most important work on this theme in Czech literature and has inspired a multitude of other works. ArnoÅ¡t Lustig, who survived both Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, entered the literary scene at the end of the 1950s. The Shoah became the topic of his life's work (for instance A Prayer for Katarina Horovitzova). ArnoÅ¡t Lustig, Ladislav Fuks (Mr. Theodor Mundstock) and other authors used persecution and extermination of the Jews also as a metaphor for man caught in the machinery of the totalitarian regime. Some of these works also became famous in film versions like The Shop on Main Street, which was inspired by the story of Ladislav Grossman and received a foreign-language Academy Award in 1965. From the end of the 1960s onwards, this theme did not play such a key role in Czech literature as it had previously. So the Shoah appears in the background of several books by Viktor Fischl who emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Israel. For the generation which had never experienced World War II, they primarily understood this theme in terms of set images and stark Holocaust iconography. Some younger authors attempted to push these borders through representing the Shoah in an unusual way, fusing the grotesque, horror, vulgarity and banality (ArnoÅ¡t Goldflam, JÃ¡chym Topol).},

 abstract = {During his entire life Kharms was deeply concerned with the question of the miracle. However, whereas the âearlyâ Kharms sincerely believed that he was a magician (miracles happening in almost all of his early texts), in his later work this belief has apparently disappeared. In âStarukhaâ, for instance, there is the motif of the magician âwho lives in our time and does not do any miraclesâ. Kharms's belief in miracles disappears from around 1935 (the murder of Kirov) when he starts to anticipate his own death. Hunger becomes the main theme of his diaries. In these circumstances he addresses himself to God. The end of âStarukhaâ and other âprayer-textsâ demonstrate that the master of the absurd did not dream of a âlife after deathâ, but accepted God's decision. Kharms's addressing God in prayers signifies the logical end of the avant-garde.},

 abstract = {Among Russian artists Pavel Filonov is the best interpreter of the basic ideas of Fedorov concerning man's destination on earth. Filonov's art can be considered an attempt to overcome the âunbrotherlyâ situation of the world. Just as Fedorov, Filonov thought that this situation was caused by urban culture â the embodiment of the mechanical principle and estrangement among people. Hence his hostile attitude towards the city (most clearly expressed in the painting Man and Woman, 1912â1913) and the emphasis on the rural, organic principle of life, which presupposes the introduction of reason and freedom into nature (examples are the anthropomorphic flower heads and stalks, and the flowerlike gardeners in his paintings). Filonov's expectations for the role of scientific knowledge in artistic work brings us back again to the philosophical ideas of Fedorov concerning the scientific and technical regulation of nature and the entire cosmos. We can see that, for instance, in titles of his paintings as The Formula of Spring, The Formula of the Blossoming of the World, The Formula of the Cosmos, The Formula of the Universe. Even in his own life Filonov was an ardent supporter of Fedorov's views, which was apparent from his negative attitude towards the selling of his paintings, his refusal of being paid for his lessons and his idea to create the future Museum of Analytical Art.},

The character of the engineer is placed in the centre of PlatonovÊ¼s drama High Voltage, by which the author tries to put a stop to the poetics based on the entropic principle, which ruins the boon of production. However, we can find the image of the engineer in both early Soviet and German cinema. Therefore, the films of the 1920s represent the possible source for the character of the engineer in Platonov. Symphony of the Donbass was filmed in the spirit of production ethics, as a kind of hymn to work. In our study, we will consider the connection between the drama High Voltage and this film in the context of PlatonovÊ¼s thoughts about Soviet man, who is swallowed by either the entropic or the energetic principle.},

 abstract = {The article surveys the problem of textual expression in Moscow Conceptualism. It discusses the peculiar way this movement constructed its pictorial art, creating a unique example of ekphrasis. It seems that the key to adequate understanding of the legacy of the Conceptualist experiment in Russian culture is the language of the comical and the diversity of the humorous agenda. Moscow Conceptualism authorizes and encourages the use of multiple languages in addition to pictorial expression per se. The article therefore analyses the ways in which Conceptualists juxtapose verbal textuality with more traditional âartworkâ. Russian Conceptualism made extensive use of cognitive dissonance, exploiting the contradictory, conflicting feeling conveyed by their art to illustrate the ironies covertly undermining societyÊ¼s official discourse. The common Conceptualist goal was to demythologize the mainstream narrative of a happy socialist society by means of ideological mockery primarily based on the concept of âstiobâ. Ekphrastic representations worked to create bitter parodies of Soviet metaphysics, travestying typical slogans of official propaganda. The essay explores unique mechanisms of embedding textual practice in the art of the elder conceptualist IlÊ¼ia Kabakov and his younger contemporary Andrei Monastyrskii. The latterÊ¼s ironic art theory is discussed in greater detail.},

The role of language acquires a unique position and in a certain way structures the conceptualist universe of carnivalesque laughter. Using the notion of cognitive dissonance, the paper offers a parallel between Zen koanic practice and what Moscow Conceptualism has been performing for nearly four decades, providing a few characteristic examples. Another portion of the text is dedicated to what is termed âSoviet mythological ideologyâ and the way the conceptualist milieu has been dealing with it. The main part of the paper focuses on Dmitrii Prigov, who continues the tradition of Kharmsian grotesque absurdism, which could be traced back to Alfred Jarry and later to Henri Michaux and Raymond Queneau (the mock-serious CollÃ¨ge de Pataphysique and related material). These issues are further elucidated in an extensive interview with the poet conducted in 2003, the English translation of which is included in this publication.},

(V.M. Zhirmunskii, Zhizn' i tvorchestvo Bairona [Life and Works of G.G. Byron]). The same year Goethe's Faust was also published, translated by N.A. Kholodkovskii, with an introductory article by Zhirmunskii. A distinctive peculiarity of these papers was a deep philosophical understanding of the works by Goethe and Byron. The main problem of Faust, as stressed in the article by Zhirmunskii, was an idea of âthe perpetual urge of the human soul which reveals the divine nature of a human beingâ. In his article about Byron, Zhirmunskii deals with the problem of so-called âByronismâ, as well as the rebelliousness and individualism of Byron's passionate characters. Zhirmunskii deals with the same problems in his later works on Goethe and Byron written in 1940 for two volumes: History of German Literature and History of English Literature. However, in the full swing of Stalin's epoch a scholar had to censor his writings, to change definitions, and to somewhat soften certain descriptive statements remaining, altogether, faithful to his overall uncompromising scholarly credo.},

 abstract = {ZhirmunskiiÊ¼s archive contains a number of note-books with poems written around 1910. From his earliest diaries during his years as a pupil of the Tenishev School (1905â1906) it is clear that Zhirmunskii at first was only interested in civic poetry. Gradually, however, and under the influence of his friend V.V. Gippius, he started to write in the tradition of the symbolists. In ZhirmunskiiÊ¼s poetry the main themes are love and religion. The present article traces the brief career of Viktor Zhirmunskii as a poet and provides background information about the poems published in the recent Zhirmunskii Special Issue of Russian Literature (LXXII-III/IV, 1 October/15 November 2012, pp. 291â349).},

 abstract = {This article presents an inquiry into the tradition of âgenetic criticismâ setting forth the principles that guide the transformation of an initial concept into the final text, based on the example of a poem by Aigi, âAugust: Nietzsche in Turinâ. This is an illustrative example both in terms of the time spent for this work (February 1967âMay 1968) and of the variety of drafts (of which there were about thirty). A comparative analysis of the drafts led to the following conclusions. In his work, Aigi proceeds from the fact that each return to the text means not the correction of particulars, but the rewriting of the text from scratch. In this case, the poet seeks to replace the direct nominations with indirect ones, and to move from lyrical expression to the neutrality of linguistic formulas, from the direct designation of cause and effect to a text-cipher, from focusing on the subject to creating objectified metaphysical formulas. The different directions that the poet's work on the discussed text took create a number of satellite poems around the central text. These satellite poems emphasise certain images or associations (âTowards the Definition of Yahoosâ, âA Morning in Ochakovoâ).},

 abstract = {This article discusses different versions of subjectivity in contemporary Russian poetry. De-subjectification â i.e. the use of different forms of indirect statement â is often deemed to be the most important tendency in modern Russian poetry. This tendency is, meanwhile, put at odds with an attempt to preserve a lyrical âegoâ as the carrier of catastrophic, transgressive experience. In this context, to be the subject means to experience painful metamorphoses; to claim to be in the act of transgression; to transition through the limit of trauma and pain. This article identifies some aspects and strains of such subjectivity: the âconstructive,â which creates the illusion of a conventional âmaskedâ subject; the âorphic,â which implies reference to the fragmentary nature of the âegoâ and the value of madness in poetic experience; and the âparodic,â which combines intense painful experiences with an ironic attitude towards suffering. All these variants consolidate the multidimensionality of the world and the interpretation of the âwoundâ as the âeye,â which allow us to establish new cause and effect relationships.},

The article analyzes the characters who symbolically represent the struggling traditions such as Peter I, Rastrelli, the wax master Iakov, and his brother Mikhalko. Finally, this paper demonstrates how parody â an important mechanism of literary evolution â plays itself out in âThe Wax Figureâ and studies Tynianov's novella in the context of Pushkin's, Gogol's and Belyi's Petersburg texts.},

 abstract = {The colour code of the archetypical, universal model of the world, which we find in all Indo-European languages, is white, black, red, yellow, green and blue. White and black and their opposition are dominant, white generally having positive connotations (light), black negative ones (darkness). In his recently discovered book Avtomaticheskie stikhi (1999) Boris Poplavskii uses a colour system that to a great extent corresponds with the universal one. Syntagmatically, however, in the opposition white/black, black is usually the stronger one, forcing white to become negative (snow, ice, death). This leads to an oxymoronic world, in which there is a âterrible sunâ and in which coldness is victorious over warmth and light.},

 abstract = {Since 1989, Marian Pankowski has been read by critics as a representative of the emancipatory discourses on identity. Enquiry into the origin of his writings, both aesthetic and ideological, has remained in the shadow of such interpretations. A feminist reading looking into the role of women helps to understand his writings in their literary and historical context. This paper examines three areas: the motherland of PankowskiÊ¼s early texts, the bunker, which symbolizes hidden, preserved histories, and liberal discourse. All these areas speak in unison and reveal the dynamics of a writing that is both revolutionary towards the existing norms and immersed in the late Modernist patriarchal idiom.},

 abstract = {Conceptualist literature can be found elsewhere in Russia besides Moscow. Information about the newest trends in Western art and literature circulated well beyond the capital city. Sergej Sigej and Rea Nikonova and their colleagues of the Uktus School in Sverdlovsk developed their own conceptualist poetry and theory as early as the mid-1960s independently of Moscow. Examples of their poetry of this sort will be examined, as well as their writings on conceptualist theory and practice. Their works include appropriations of ready-mades, poems in the form of charts, instructions for poetic âactionsâ and, in general, the various genres of what they term âtransponirovanieâ [transposition], which involved using found material in new artistic environments. On this basis, one can credibly conclude that conceptualism was not exclusively a Moscow phenomenon.},

Citationality is first discussed from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to distinguish between different terms and concepts within this field. In Rubinshtein's text citationality takes the form of direct references to biblical texts, to Pushkin, especially his poem âThe Prophetâ, to other classical writers such as Gogol' and Chekhov. On the other hand, a large part of âThe Six-winged Seraphâ consists of quasi-quotations, phrases that sound like quotations but cannot be identified as such. They appear as âcitations of stylesâ, as the interest in language stereotypes is a general feature of the Moscow Conceptualists, including Rubinshtein.},

 abstract = {Gombrowicz's oeuvre is routinely described by referring it to the grotesque. It seems that in the case of Gombrowicz the grotesque is connected with dismemberment and decomposition. The motive of this artistic device must be sought in the author's entanglement in the horrors of twentieth-century history and his artistic preoccupation with avant-garde literature. If the human body can be subjected to dismemberment, then all forms are exposed to the same kind of decomposition. We discover that the wholeness of the world is in reality a result of being accustomed to certain forms. The task of modern literature lies in undermining the cultural foundations of these apparently self-evident forms. This project has an essential bearing on the organization of meaning in Gombrowicz's texts. The story is broken up and put together according to certain (quasi) logical chains that show the underlying mutability of life. These chains lack stability, are provisional, fall to pieces almost at the very moment when they are established.},

 abstract = {Maturity and immaturity are the hallmarks of Witold Gombrowiczâs literary texts. They were introduced in his first novel, Ferdydurke, and an early collection of short stories, Memoirs from a Time of Immaturity, and continued to play a central role in his fiction and nonfiction works, including the Diary, A Kind of Testament, and the penultimate novel, Pornografia. Although Gombrowicz has been widely regarded as a staunch critic of maturity and defender of immature spontaneity, playfulness, and formlessness, this view is largely based on his earlier writings. Later works offer a more complex image of Gombrowicz. Pornografia, in particular, no longer pits immaturity against maturity with the goal of discrediting the latter through humor and irony. Instead, it experiments with the possibility of a new relationship between the two, a relationship which would ameliorate the discontents that often come with aging.},

In the first part, the genealogical background of the novel is addressed, and how the text can be approached within its genre, the socialist realistic novel. In the second part, the portrait of the heroine is in focus. It is demonstrated that the novelist, paralysed in her work by official literary control, could quote her heroine's, Skobcova's, authentic writings only selectively. In consequence, the novel portrays the heroine as an archetypal âprodigal daughterâ, a puppet-like naÃ¯ve person who repents of her political errors and wishes to âconvertâ, that is, to be accepted by the Bolsheviks. In this rigorous example of the Soviet mass novel, the heroine is represented as a martyred struggler of the anti-fascist Resistance, but her authentic personality, her oeuvre as well as theological views are systematically ignored. As this essay argues, the novel is no biography. It provides a clichÃ©d portrait which has little in common with the historical person, whose authentic writings and visual art have only recently reached a Russian audience.},

 abstract = {Analyzing biographical narratives shows that, in addition to commemorative functions related to individual achievements, biography is involved in the continuous production of values â contributing not only to the preservation of the existing order but to its ongoing modification. This article explores the concept of the âgreat manâ through two main components: as a heroic person (with a history of military and other exploits, demonstrations of courage) and as a genius (a person endowed with exceptional abilities). At the turn from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century, the concept of genius in particular reflected new ideas about the scale and significance of the historical person. On the one hand, genius could be understood as a soaring creative spirit (the genius-creator), an individualistic concept; and on the other, as a manifestation of a collective identity, the people (national genius). Lomonosovâs biographies demonstrate such changes in the concept of genius: a transition from French to German cultural influences, from creative individualism to the unity of the nation. Secularization and returns to religion contribute to the ongoing story: in the Soviet era, Lomonosov embodied the creative potential of the people and the nation, but as the status of Orthodoxy changes in the search for a new ideology in twenty-first-century Russia, the great Russian scientist and poet regains a religious aura, reinforced by national and even nationalistic pathos.},

 abstract = {Similarly to many other important terms of our social vocabulary, the concept of dignity is employed within different discourses, but in Russia a special role in its development belongs to literature. This article discusses the use of the collocation âdignity of a poetâ in Russia in the 18th century, when cultural production started to become autonomized and the status of âbeing a writerâ became â or at least was declared to be â capable of bringing fame and recognition. Historical semantics can contribute to comprehending the processes that helped establish this particular status of literary authors. The case of Aleksandr Sumarokov is particularly indicative, for it is located at the intersection of two logics related to two different realms. One is the realm of power, where dignity is determined by rank, and the other is the new realm of literature, where âdignityâ of the author is determined by the literary merit of his texts and by public opinion. By making literature his main occupation, Sumarokov lost his âdignity of a noblemanâ and acquired the âdignity of a poetâ, which at the time lacked proper social significance. This shift accounted for tragic conflicts in his life.},

It explores the similarities and differences between these works and BelyiÊ¼s own culturo-historical project. It will be argued that BelyiÊ¼s ISSD, with its characteristic concept of a spiraliform evolution of culture, can be understood in methodological terms as a synthesis of ChamberlainÊ¼s linear with SpenglerÊ¼s cyclical view of cultural history. As a conception of evolving human self-consciousness, understood as the decisive driving force of cultural development, BelyiÊ¼s anthropological view surpasses former biological references to a cultural-historical morphology in both the concepts of Darwinist racial conflict (Chamberlain) and botanical life cycles (Spengler). This methodological focus of BelyiÊ¼s work is also reflected in its stylistic aspects.},

Lomonosovâs early iambs show a noticeable foreign influence, whereas the prosodic structure of Sumarokovâs poems was formed in a fundamentally different way from the very start. The research presented in this article provides a new understanding of the sources of the rhythm of Sumarokovâs iambic verses, which represent a distinctive vector in the development of Russian verse. This vector displays significant differences from the principles of continental, West European syllabo-tonic poetry; an attempt at mastering whose principles can be observed in the early Lomonosov.},

This research attempts to reconstruct how this situation was built on earlier periods of the development of Russian verse. Its results place in doubt the classic notion that the prevalence of pyrrhic feet arose out of the substantial length of the Russian word. A comparison of how the rhythm of iambic tetrameter developed in Dutch, German, and Russian verse shows that the level of metrical flexibility does not depend on the average length of the rhythmic (phonetic) word in a language. The historical conditions surrounding the emergence of syllabotonic verse and the evolution of versification clearly played a decisive role in the prevalence of pyrrhic feet in Russian verse.},

Some names, and hence characters, serve as shadow images of the principal name in definition and in their roles within the work. Attendant points of interest receive treatment, such as the role of names that aid in pinpointing the most likely geographical location of the estates of the Larins, Lenskij, and Onegin's uncle.},

 abstract = {Many discussions of Viktor Pelevin's oeuvre give a nod to his irony. This essay subjects the issue to closer scrutiny. I examine key ironic modes in Pelevin's oeuvre â from stable (Augustan) irony that exposes the follies of society and humans, to a less secure Romantic irony that stresses the limits of language vis-Ã -vis life and selfhood, and plays with paradoxes and self-refuting speech acts, to the highly unstable postmodern irony that destabilizes all kinds of discourses and envisions the subject as an effect of narration. Both irony and self-irony run through his works but it is the latter that, I argue, is pivotal to Pelevin's poetics. Pelevin constructs ironic mechanisms by which the narrative turns on itself, and directs ironic ire at himself as much as at external targets (everyday concepts and values). This multiplication of ironies, I hypothesize, suggests authorial attempts to escape his own bounds and is analogous to a key motif of Pelevin's works â his protagonists' struggle to make a break from their prison-like existences.},

The author demonstrates that the Gothic imposes a language and aesthetic that resonate not only with post-Soviet fiction but also with the neo-Eurasian dream of a New Russian Middle Ages. Neo-Eurasian ideology becomes a potent tool for subverting the concepts of democracy and citizenship in Russia, offering, to the same extent as the post-Soviet vampire novel, a caste utopia as Russiaâs future. The relations between the Gothic and historical memory are another important focus of this article.},

 abstract = {The main body of my arguments demonstrates in which artistic principles and literary framework Pushkin's texts are interwoven with each other. This study explores why the cycle must be called a fine literary model, experimental norm, and projection of a completely new style at the time. Through this synthetic interpretation of the cycle, I finally suggest that Pushkin's The Tales of Belkin paves a completely new path to the development of the Russian short story with a special emphasis on thematic unity. In this internally planned plot formation, events from Pushkin's biography, especially his immature youthful pranks and wishful hope to have a happy marriage, are also considered. Speaking of the embedded text penetrating throughout the cycle, I maintain that traditional Russian wedding rituals are certainly the most recurrent folkloric motif. Structurally analyzing each tale, I have in mind this dominant motif as to how it contributes to encoding the writer's artistic design within the texts and how it creatively formulates a unifying thematic structure for the cycle.},

In Pasternak's world, the border between life and death, eternity and moment, and god and human disappears and resurrection enters into a close relation with memory, and through this, religious and philosophical characteristics are reinforced in the work.},

@article{KLEBANOV2011309,
 abstract = {It can be argued that the OBERIU Theatre, whose agenda was proclaimed in 1929, sought to challenge the dominance of Meyerhold on the Russian experimental theatrical scene of the day, much as Meyerhold in his early days departed from seeking more radical alternatives to the Stanislavsky system. However, whereas his âbiomechanicsâ proceeded from the ambition to free theatre from its dependence on literature, his actors were not relieved of verbal speech, although particular intensity was imparted to their body language. In essence, MeyerholdÊ¼s theatre still followed the rules of the imagined world of literature, even if those were interpreted afresh by the means of a new language of representation. OBERIU devotees of âreal (concrete) artâ, on the contrary, strove to present, rather than represent, as their Manifesto states, âthe world of concrete objects onstage in their interaction and collisionâ. They asserted that the laws of ârealityâ are inapplicable in the âalternativeâ reality of theatre, which therefore should follow only its own rules, regardless of conventions imposed by literature and everyday life. This paper aims to explore the relationship between the two mindsets, with an emphasis on the novelty of OBERIU ideas, which at the time went almost completely unnoticed.},

He was acting at interviews and TV shows, embarking on prolonged quasi-scientific soliloquies in front of bemused audiences. Even his political pursuits seem to have amounted to a kind of deluding buffoonery. KurekhinÊ¼s many modes of performing always, or nearly always, involved laughter: the probing kind of laughter revelling in the newly found political freedom of action in the Gorbachovian Society of Spectacle and subsequently, in the Yeltsinian reality of âdiscarded valuesâ. The paper endeavours to trace the origins and uncover the subtleties of KurekhinÊ¼s facetious attitude in its apparent ubiquity, with a special focus on his contribution to the peculiar Russian phenomenon of stiob that eventually became his primary strategic tool of manipulation.},

 abstract = {It has been a longstanding tendency in contemporary cultural analysis to associate reputedly avant-garde authors and artists with left-wing political leanings. In the particular case of Russian post-revolutionary Modernism there is generally little doubt today that its protagonists were en masse pro-Communist or at least sympathized with the dominant state ideology to some degree. It appears possible, however, to offset the ideological affiliation of the last generation of Russian Modernists, namely those associated with the OBERIU circle, from the mainstream beliefs of their colleagues. With due analytical diligence, the contradictory self-referential terminology of titles like âThe Academy of Left Classicistsâ or âThree Left Hoursâ can be ascertained to evince aesthetical rather than political radicalism. In public opinion, the true political views of Daniil Kharms still remain a matter of controversy. It may prove a futile endeavour to find out whether Kharms divulged any kind of truth to his NKVD interrogators. However, his own textual legacy contains paramount evidence to his clerical, monarchist, and in other ways conservative, if not at times reactionary, personal and ideological agenda. In a way, the same was true for most of his OBERIU peers, whether Vvedenskii, Zabolotskii or Vaginov. The proposed article aims to analyse this textual evidence and reconstruct the ideological mindset of Daniil Kharms in an attempt to conclude the discussion that has been going on for years without clear resolution.},

 abstract = {This essay explores the specific strategies Alexander and Natalie Herzen use to weave the personal stories of their family drama into the grand narrative of history. Ilya Kliger traces the âemplotmentâ, or narrative organization of events, shaped by plots and tropes borrowed from literature. He deals with Natalie's letters and journal entries from 1848â1852 and with Herzen's My Past and Thoughts, paying special attention to Section Two of Book Five of the memoirs. Kliger's close reading of the two sets of texts reveals that both Natalie and Alexander Herzen, in trying to situate, by narrative means, their personal experiences in the wider social context, are guided primarily by the master trope of synecdoche. Their conception of history is essentially organicist, leading them to perceive their lives as microcosmic figurations of the historical totality of which they are parts. The essay also suggests a way of reading Herzen's account of the drama as a polemic with Hegel's The Phenomenology of Spirit and with the pattern of the Bildungsroman.},

Yet the two formalisms diverge starkly when it comes to three of their most fundamental categories of analysis: first, in their respective conceptions of literary form itself; next, in their notions of history and of what it means to tell the history of form; and finally, in the ways in which they construe the relationship between literature and society as a whole, or, in other words, in their corresponding sociologies of literary form. This paper, then, is a contribution to creating the conditions for the possibility of a genuine exchange between the two formalisms here at issue by focusing, first and foremost, on what divides them.},

 abstract = {Based on archival findings, the paper traces the itinerary of Shalamovâs manuscript from Moscow to the United States, where it was serialized, in an edited form, in the Russian Ã©migrÃ© periodical Novyi zhurnal from 1966 until 1978. It focuses on the patterns of its reception across generations of Russian Ã©migrÃ© writers and critics and situates Kolymskie rasskazy in the socio-political and linguistic contexts of its first tamizdat publication. The paper also analyzes the western reception of Kolymskie rasskazy vis-Ã -vis Solzhenitsynâs novella Odin denâ Ivana Denisovicha, which seems to have overshadowed nearly every other text on the Gulag topic since its official publication in Novyi mir in 1962. It argues that the formal(ist) features of Shalamovâs ânew proseâ remained ultimately inaccessible to the older generation of Russian Ã©migrÃ© critics, who lacked the necessary familiarity with the new Soviet language, let alone a first-hand experience of the Gulag, where much of this language and Soviet culture in general had been tempered. The example of Kolymskie rasskazy and the history of its first publication and reception abroad is used as a case study of the transnational network of tamizdat, which mediated the relationships of many Soviet authors, including Shalamov, with official state publishing (or gosizdat), on the one hand, and with the non-conformist literary underground, including samizdat, on the other.},

 abstract = {Russian postmodernist writers have undertaken a thorough revision of the norms governing the construction of fictional characters. They have exploited a great number of experimental strategies to demonstrate that character is one of many components of narrative structure created and maintained by verbal means. The boldest and most striking strategies involve the category of extratextual characters which merge the historical and the fantastic and juxtapose divergent temporal and spatial dimensions. In the case of intertextual characters, Russian postmodernist writers introduce the most recognizable formulaic characters lifted from fairy tales and myths in order to expose their inherited and invented nature and to re-arrange their narrative functions. As for the largest category of intratextual characters, Russian writers subvert all the forms of direct and indirect characterization to indicate that fictional characters are completely rooted in language to the exclusion of any reference to an extralinguistic reality. It would not be an exaggeration to say, that Russian postmodernist texts use characters to flaunt their textuality and to foreground the fact that representational character is a mere convention.},

 abstract = {This article addresses the spiritual worldview of Elena Shvarts as it appears in her poetry. Shvarts's poetic universe is based on an idiosyncratic view of the world that draws on various sources. Spiritual sources of her poetry have been traced to Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, Catholicism as well as to various occult esoteric movements. In this essay I shall focus on manifestations of Gnosticism within her syncretistic Weltanschauung. Gnosticism is conceived as a particular existential position comprising an alienated pessimistic attitude towards the surrounding world and an attempt to free oneself from the chains of the social and political reality â a position which Shvarts shared with many other poets of the Leningrad âsecond cultureâ. Her experience of the world in its essence is both mythological and mystical. Myth serves in her poetry as a spiritual model, which helps the poet to comprehend and depict the relation of the metaphysical reality to the physical world. She liberates religious motifs from traditional modes of expression and meanings in her striving to find new forms for her personal spiritual experience. In addition to her lyric works, Gnostic themes and symbols appear also in Shvarts's short prose and essays. This article concentrates on her Petersburg poetry. Her native city with its dualistic mythology serves as an adequate setting to demonstrate her worldview.},

 abstract = {The article discusses the connection between poetic subjectivity and spatial structures in Gennadii Aigi's poetry. The spatial image of âpoleâ (field) is crucial for the poet, as it possesses a number of stable features, such as the presence of border, observation point and relief. The same traits are present in another spatial image of Aigi's early poetry â the image of âpolianaâ (clearing). These two related spatial entities constitute a specific intermediate type of space located between the woods and the countryside; the in-betweenness of this space reflects the in-betweenness of poetic subjectivity and its links with different types of space.},

 abstract = {The two most prominent innovations for 20th century poetry were the cinema and a specific kind of corporeality that embedded itself in literary milieus. Although these two innovations took place in the first quarter of the 20th century, their impact on poetry became evident only much later, and they still influence and shape the contemporary Russian poetry. This article analyzes how these two innovations induced changes in the design of poetic texts and their modes of subjectivity, particularly in contemporary Russian poetry, which regards them at this point not as experiments but as well-established practices. The article offers an exploration of the subject in philosophy which is then applied to a more detailed description of the connections between poetry and cinema since the historical avant-garde (Aleksei Kruchenykh). The essay concludes with a comparative discussion focused on the Russian poetry of the last 25 years (Aleksandr Skidan, Leonid Schwab, Nina Stavrogina).},

I will demonstrate the exclusion of these stories from the literary history of The Great Patriotic War (in the 1950s), make a detailed account of the program and history of adapting PlatonovÊ¼s wartime fiction to the Soviet literary ideology (The Khrushchev Thaw era; 1970â1980s): severe editing of all of the stories published at the time; total absence of any information on PlatonovÊ¼s lifetime criticism from academic works on the war stories; complete ignoring of the wartime literatureÊ¼s chronology. The lifetime criticism of the war stories (1942â1946/7) is argued to provide the most interesting and promising data for contemporary Platonov studies. The article draws on rich material from archival sources and Soviet periodicals.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to highlight the close ties between experiments in Soviet science and art; between the official and the unofficial in Soviet art and culture in the 1960s. I focus on the work of the physicist and filmmaker Bulat Galeev (1940â2009) and the cinematic experiments he conducted under the auspices of the radiomechanics laboratory at the Aviation Institute in Kazan. Inspired by the writings of Aleksandr Skriabin on music, light and synesthesia, Galeev founded the Special Construction Bureau (SKB) Prometei in 1962, where his team engaged in research and experimentation with recorded light and sound, producing films intended officially for Soviet astronauts. I look at Galeevâs early films and his publications on art and science, especially his writing on the early Russian and Soviet Avant-garde, to trace the conceptual and institutional connections that inspired and promoted his work at Prometei. I also look at interviews with Galeev and his later publications to draw attention to the larger community of scientists who created artistic work under the umbrella of the Soviet military-industrial complex.},

The author compares PankowskiÊ¼s work to that of Tadeusz Borowski and Imre KertÃ©sz, and stresses its anti-martyrological character. Typical is its analysis of the moral consequences of the camp experience, and especially the issue of the moral degradation of the victim. The characteristic feature of the analysed works by Pankowski is the tendency to cross the line between the accepted and the taboo. The most striking example of this propensity is the combination of stories about the camp life with a narration of erotic imagination. This is visible, for example, in the story âMoja SS RottenfÃ¼hrer Johannaâ (âMy SS RottenfÃ¼hrer Johannaâ), which describes an affair between a Polish inmate and a German female SS-officer. This is one of many examples of the way in which Pankowski transgresses the convention of camp literature.},

Very often in this context most important is information about the contacts and personal relations between major authors. Of course, for literary scholars biographical material is mainly auxiliary and assists them in comprehending the writer's work. However, in any case this material should be based on reliable and controllable information. The history of the Russian bard song (âauthor songâ) has only begun to be written, but already after a short time, one can easily observe a great number of unreliable and/or mythologized data, that will not pass the test of available correct information. In our article an attempt is made to set more or less exact points of orientation for the investigation into an important event: the acquaintance with each other's works, and subsequently the personal acquaintance of two authors, whose significance for the âauthor songâ is beyond doubt: Bulat Okudzhava and Vladimir Vysotskii.},

@article{KUDRJAVTSEVA200697,
 abstract = {This article presents a thorough-going account of Joseph Brodsky's poem âEclogue 4: Winterâ. In particular, it provides a detailed study of the relationship between this poem and the Fourth Eclogue of the Roman poet Virgil. While this relationship has most commonly been read in primarily temporal terms (in interpretations which emphasise the prophetic element in Virgil's so-called âMessianic Eclogueâ), the present article argues that the poem's carefully choreographed series of spatial contrasts is at least as important for the construction of its meaning. Indeed, the opposition between Brodsky's North and Virgil's South determines the strategy of this poem to such an extent that â controversially for Brodsky â space is thereby rendered a more significant category in it than time. By carving out a place for itself in relation to its cultural tradition (including the Russian classicising tradition) as well as to the cosmos, Brodsky's Winter Eclogue duly identifies the North as the outskirts at which eternity itself unravels.},

 abstract = {Theorists of social media and the information society such as Manuel Castells have paid attention, first of all, to their modernizing and emancipatory potential. A new wave of such theorists, however, point out that social media promote not only the establishment of connections between different segments of society, but also the closing of âfilter bubblesâ, as they were designated by Eli Pariser. This essay is focused on depicting how âfilter bubblesâ enhance both innovative and archaizing types of poetic writing in a period when much new poetry is being published in social media. A vivid example of archaization is the cultural legitimization of amateurish genres and styles in some online communities. This process of divergence of innovative and conservative styles strengthens ânon-simultaneityâ â an English translation of the German term Ungleichzeitigkeit widespread due to the works of the philosopher Ernst Bloch. This paper is aimed at outlining a theory connecting the concepts of non-simultaneity, âfilter bubblesâ and âEigenzeitâ (a term coined by the philosopher Helga Nowotny) in the interpretation of online poetic publications.},

@article{KUKULIN202079,
 abstract = {In the mid-2010s, rap suddenly (for many external observers) became one of the most important genres in Russian pop culture. Recordings of rap battles and videos of new rap songs receive millions of views on YouTube within a month or two. At the same time, Russian rap became more and more saturated with images of violence and rhetorics of success and personal domination; nevertheless, counter-currents such as, primarily, female rap and political satire rap, can also easily be discovered. This paper presents a social-theoretical interpretation of these transformations. The main argument is as follows: Russian society in the 2010s entered a state of covert anomie. The combination of increasing social stagnation and persistent openness to Western pop culture produced an unpredictable effect: the emergence of a âhybridâ subaltern in Russian society â a âmaskâ of a subaltern, involved in perseverating the reproduction of performances expressing revolt. However, this revolt is mocking and self-ironical and not intended to bring about any social change. This scenario of a âmock fightâ charged with images of compensatory violence is the most popular type of narration in Russian rap, but it is not the only type: it is increasingly being âoustedâ by politically charged rap, which presents the state as a main actor of violence and psychological pressure.},

 abstract = {For much of the twentieth century, Russian literary scholarship on lyric subjectivity was impeded by its isolation from global philosophical thought, which was, at the time, reconsidering the very category of the subject. In the twenty-first century, as researchers have begun to bridge this gap, their efforts have been paralleled by the work of certain poets who themselves explicitly appeal to current world philosophy in their writings. The poetry of Aleksandr Skidan (b. 1965), who relies directly on Deleuzian concepts in his understanding of the nature of the âI,â linking his poems intertextually to the works of Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Giorgio Agamben, offers particular interest for researchers of subjectivity in contemporary Russian poetic texts. Skidanâs âraggedâ writing, in which heavily fragmented language coincides with the recurrent theme of bodily dismemberment, articulating in this manner an analytical discourse of trauma, may be described as a form of âfraggingâ â the subversion of discursive cohesiveness that scholars in the United States have attributed to American poetry of the Vietnam War era. The unique innovation of Skidanâs poetics of fragging derives from its intertextual elements, including foreign-language interpolations. In his poetry, Skidan explores the multilevel disintegration of the text as an active practice that ultimately works towards the reestablishment of the authority of the subject.},

The author analyzes selected works by the poet Igorâ Severianin from the period before his emigration (1908â1918) in the context of theories of parody, and compares his texts with Symbolist poetry and the Silver Age genre of literary parody. Severianinâs innovative poetic techniques (hyperbolism, paradox, stylistic mixing, laying bare of the device, literal treatment of metaphors, reductio ad absurdum) are explained through the lens of parody. In the poetâs oeuvre we find parodic transformation (ironic refraction) of recognizable themes, images, masks, myths, and lexical clichÃ©s of symbolism. Modernist poetic discourse is therefore objectified by means of playful deflation and mockery from a position of total authorial irony.},

I suggest that Tolstoy is a theistic moral realist who believes that Godâs will identifies the mind-independent truths of morality. He also thinks that, roughly, it suffices to heed natural moral emotions (like love and compassion) to know the right thing to do, that is, Godâs will. In appraising Tolstoyâs interesting and original theory, which I dub âtheistic populist sentimentalismâ, I argue that it prima facie runs into a string of fallacies and undertakes dubious assumptions that render it open to question.},

 abstract = {This paper examines two novels from either side of the bipolar Cold War â Vladimir Sorokinâs Blue Lard (Goluboe salo, 1999) and Don DeLilloâs Underworld (1997) â and their approaches to narrative temporality and nuclear waste. Building upon interdisciplinary theories of nuclear fallout, climate change, the Anthropocene epoch, and narrative time, I argue that both novels struggle to dramatically expand their temporal structures to accommodate larger-than-human timescales, extending into the future as well as the past. The eponymous substance of Sorokinâs novel, often connected and compared to nuclear byproduct, transgresses the boundaries of time, moving from the future to the past and back again. DeLilloâs novel, by contrast, depicts a world that is at once saturated with wastes and deeply invested in concealing them from view. As with Blue Lard, the structure of the novel attempts to resolve this tension between âthe two streams of history, weapons and wasteâ. In my comparison of the two novels, I theorize a âbyproduct temporalityâ, which pulls the texts away from individual lifetimes or historical periods and toward toxic objects that transgress and problematize perceptual human time. Finally, both novels dramatize how societies try and inevitably fail to bury hazardous materials and, within the structures of the novels, unbury the nuclear detritus of our collective past.},

 abstract = {In this study I consider the role of poetic description in PasternakÊ¼s âDeviatÊ¼sot piatyi godâ (â1905â) in the context of the genre of the poema. Descriptive passages in poetic narratives, as a rule, provide a static setting for a protagonistÊ¼s actions. In the absence of any single hero in PasternakÊ¼s poema, topography itself begins to move. I examine the categories of stasis and motion, central to â1905â, at the intersection of the visual and the verbal. The idea of reanimating the events of the first Russian revolution twenty years after the fact borders on the ekphrastic in places, where the poet transposes techniques and genres from the visual arts into a verse epic. Finally, I suggest that aesthetic perception itself is the dominant principle in the poema, as opposed to documentary faithfulness, which is traditionally emphasized in the scholarship on this work.},

The conflict was provoked by Medtner's intention to publish an anti-Steinerian treatise, Vigilemus!, by Ällis, against which Belyi and his anthroposophical friends protested. As a result, Belyi demonstratively left the Musaget editorial board, of which he was a member. The article is followed by an important document which throws light on this history, âEmil Medtner's File on Vigilemus!â. Special attention is given to the analysis of Medtner's struggles with censorship within Musaget, from both the anthroposophical side (Andrei Belyi) and the Catholic side (Ällis).},

The article shows that the suicide scene, disguised as a single combat between Achilles and Hector, reflects the inner struggle between the divided selves of Raskol'nikov on the subconscious level. Dostoevskii's use of the classical motif is interpreted to suggest the influence of a fatal force on the novel's main characters.},

Starting from Walter Benjamin's idea that there is no qualitative difference between original and translation in an age of technical reproduction, the author reflects upon the many aspects of an endless continuation of writing within the field of tension between originality and non-originality. Prominent in Sigej's work are devices of a âtotalâ recycling and âreâ-remaking of the âgotovaja formaâ. In connection with the genesis of Nikonova's book Å val' (1971â1973) there is a discussion of the poet's transpositional devices that develop into textual âapotheoses without any frillsâ. Bearing in mind Nikonova's later âarchiteksturyâ, which with their vectors and textual traverses define places without space, an analogy is made with Jacques Derrida's concept of grammatology and Peter Eisenman's theory of architecture.},

This debate became a crucial point in the history of childrenâs literature of the late 1920s â early 1930s. Kuzâka was a joint project of the best childrenâs illustrators and authors of that time: the graphic artist Alexey Laptev, and writers and poets Lev Kassil, Nikolay Agnivtsev, and Daniil Kharms. This paper focuses on the ideological attack on Kuzâka led by Pionerskaia Pravda, the magazineâs desperate resistance, and its final defeat, which resulted in the characterâs comic death and travesty mourning.},

 abstract = {The article examines a curious resurgence of the Gothic mode in late Soviet culture. As the author shows, in the 1970s and 1980s the Gothic served an important function in the fast-developing discourse of Russian nationalism. The article identifies this ânationalist Gothicâ in the works of the understudied, yet influential late Soviet poet, Iurii Kuznetsov. Gothic discourse was unusual for mainstream Soviet literature and aesthetics, but this very exoticism also made it appealing for the articulation of a non-conformist historical consciousness. Close readings show how Kuznetsov deployed Gothic conceptions of the lingering presence of an irrational, primordial past as an alternative to the increasingly discredited Soviet ideology of modernity and futurity. In this, the poet articulated the crisis in Soviet society. Tracing Kuznetsovâs career and reputation forward into the post-Soviet years, the article demonstrates how, despite the fact that in a conservative context (such as late Soviet culture), the Gothic aesthetic can serve as a powerful form of cultural criticism, it nevertheless harbors dangerous potential for extreme nationalist and even fascist ideological formations.},

 abstract = {In this article the legendary radio programme of the 1970s, Radioniania (Radio Nanny), is described as a symptomatic example of late Soviet radio broadcasting. Officially, the programme, which was both educational and entertaining, was directed at young children, but it reached a much wider audience. The reason why it became so popular had to do with changes in the system of education and also with changes in the relation between the individual and the state: at that time it became less obligatory to resign oneself to the âomnipotentâ authorities.},

Discussion focuses on the following issues in the context of âpluralistâ postmodern aesthetics in Russia: ambiguity as multilingualism and its hero-intermediary, simulacra and homonymy, or the category of the âneo-realâ, as Jean Baudrillard formulated it, in connection with stylization. Finally, it is maintained that the oversaturation of our contemporary culture with signs replacing reality has exhausted their potential âto meanâ and invites the theme of Apocalypse as a last resort for producing meaning. Two ways out of this impasse seem to emerge in the mid-1990s: on the one hand, documentary genres; on the other, their opposite â the mythological novel. The aesthetic development of the 1990s seems, however, to have been impeded by the shrinking freedom of cultural expression in Russia.},

Her studies are regarded here as an âopenâ text, unfinished and ongoing. The importance of the oral performance is stressed; it uses âpushkinizmâ to create a theatralized act of commemoration. A wider question is raised in this connection, that of the unofficial culture in Leningrad as being a culture of conservation, rather that of dissent. There the most prominent part was played not only by a poet, but also by a scholar.},

The shift from the informal gatherings on Mayakovsky Square to the enormous gatherings in Luzhniki is used to examine how poetry provoked a political response from the highest ranks of the Party leadership, and how poets responded to the rebukes both in poetry and other ways.},

 abstract = {This article explores the way Candlemas Day is represented in Joseph Brodsky's poem of the same name (1972). The poem is considered in the light of the poet Brodsky's personal relations with the poet Anna Akhmatova, to whom âCandlemas Dayâ is dedicated. Even though Brodsky follows the text of the Gospel of Luke, he âhumanizesâ the encounter between Simeon and the Child and foregrounds the prophetess Anna. In the image of the prophetess there appears another Anna â Anna Akhmatova as a guardian of poetic tradition. We are led even further from the canonical Candlemas by the absence of Joseph, who on icons is always present, holding two doves. But the âbirdâ of Joseph is still present in Brodsky's verse as an echo of the words that prophesy the future of the Child. The poetic Word, embodied in the poem, becomes just such a sacrifice, a tribute to tradition as Joseph's doves â however, not to God, but to Poetry.},

@article{LORENZ202087,
 abstract = {This article examines Dobroliubovâs early reception of Chernyshevskiiâs aesthetics as expressed in an unpublished essay on literary didacticism and in diary entries from 1857. Critics at the time linked Dobroliubov closely to Chernyshevskii, labeling both of them as adherents of âdidacticâ or âutilitarianâ aesthetics. These private compositions demonstrate, however, that Dobroliubov was reworking Chernyshevskiiâs ideas even before he made his print debut in Sovremennik. I analyze how Dobroliubov enthusiastically defends his elder colleague while at the same time departing from Chernyshevskiiâs iconoclastic, rationalist vision of realityâs superiority over art. Dobroliubov melds the âorganicâ perspective of Belinskiiâs aesthetics with the views expressed in Chernyshevskiiâs dissertation to produce a moderated utilitarian theory that retains reverence for the special powers of art. Dobroliubovâs vision of the relationship between art and reality is also inflected by his youthful sense that âlifeâ was just beginning to reveal exciting professional and romantic potential. The article offers a nuanced understanding of the utilitarianism in Dobroliubovâs aesthetics, distinguishes him clearly from his sometimes more prominent elder colleague, and contributes to a fuller understanding of aesthetic utilitarianism and mid-nineteenth-century Russian culture in general.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on late-socialist interpretations of a prominent myth in Russian cultural history: the matrifocal myth of âthe Russian womanâ in the journal Rabotnitsa and the novels The Ladiesâ Hairdresser (Damskii master, 1963) by Irina Grekova, A Week Like Any Other (Nedelia kak nedelia, 1969) by Natalâia Baranskaia, and Night Time (Vremia nochâ, 1992) by Liudmila Petrushevskaia. Following the development and articulation of the matrifocal myth through diachronic and synchronic perspectives, the article builds on the cultural history of myth; Malinowski and Blumenbergâs functionalist theory of myth; and Butlerâs performative gender and its subversive dialectics. The author argues that the above-mentioned texts deconstruct the Other, the unknown of the matrifocal myth, and at the same time use it to structure the narrative identity of the protagonist: the mother-woman. The narrative identity â the image of the woman, the âIâ of the represented world â is constructed with self-abnegation/absence/disappearance/death. In other words, the void is a constituent part of this image or the unavoidable centre of its existence. Central to the paper are the following questions: What is distinctive about the myth as a discursive practice, especially in its dialogue with fiction? What is the subjectâs position therein? And how is the myth âtransformedâ into fiction?},

 abstract = {The article focuses on KharmsÊ¼ critical review of the concert given by the pianist EmilÊ¼ GilelÊ¼s in 1939 in Leningrad. The author finds evidence that the Chopin analysis is a projection of KharmsÊ¼ thoughts about his own creativity and an attempt to come to better understanding of the role narrativity plays in literature. In his literary works Kharms follows a similar strategy as does Chopin in his mazurka: he surprises the reader by such a development of the plot-line that consciously refutes any literary model. In his review, Kharms demonstrates not only the unconventional organisation of the musical material and the lack of dynamism of the musical form but also his own approach towards and explanation of such phenomena in general, both in music and in literature.},

 abstract = {The present paper reconstructs and examines a plot of friendship and split between two famous Russian philologists, Boris Eikhenbaum and Viktor Zhirmunskii. The starting point is that a quarrel itself is under implicit taboo within academic profession and has to be substituted by alternative forms, i.e. public and intimate text production (articles, reviews, letters, diaries). This multi-genre textual array could generate an independent story which demonstrates complicated reference to reality. The paper is devoted to the case of academic quarrel as a specific kind of narrative encoding psychological and worldview drama between closest friends.},

 abstract = {This article argues that both the Russian Formalists and Digital Humanists infer meaning from patterns of development in literature. Key to this comparison is the figure of Boris Iarkho, whose statistics- and biology-driven methodology based on large corpora of texts anticipated Digital Humanities by more than a half century. One of the main tasks of the article is to contextualize Iarkhoâs work. By comparing Iarkho with Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, and other Digital Humanists, I hope to demonstrate the relevance of Russian Formalism and Digital Humanities to one another. The former offers theoretical and methodological depth, the latter the opportunity to carry on with the projects launched by Iarkho and other Russian Formalists. At the same time, the comparison with Digital Humanities reveals some fundamental discrepancies within Russian Formalism, namely, between Iarkho and the group of Viktor Shklovskii. I show that they were diametrically opposed to each other in their understanding of literary evolution and form. I argue that these divergences, distinguishable in Russian Formalism thanks to Digital Humanities, can enrich our dialogue about the value, status, and meaning of literature.},

 abstract = {Fedor Sologubâs interest in magic, the demonic and the supernatural culminates in his novel The Petty Demon (Melkii Bes, 1905) and the trilogy The Created Legend (Tvorimaia legenda, 1907â1913, 1914). The Petty Demon offers a gloomy vision of a provincial Russian town (a model of Russia as a whole, at the very least) as a possessed place. Although Sologub hardly depicts any demonic activities graphically, he gives plenty of indirect references to witchcraft, black magic, and the presence of unclean forces. The Created Legend represents an attempt to offer a âpositive programâ for the lost society. Set in Russia in the early days of the revolution of 1905â1907 and in a fictitious kingdom, the United Isles of the Mediterranean, it introduces new themes in addition to the previously explored black magic and the demonic: political activism, alternative education, scientific thought and âtheurgicalâ creation. The trilogy professes the ability of creative consciousness to transform the conditions of life for the better. Taken together, the two works illustrate the authorâs belief that manâs energy can be used not only with negative (destructive and âdemonicâ) intentions but also with positive (creative) ones.},

 abstract = {While literary history normally avoids using political milestones to define literary epochs, we can hardly ignore that (particularly when it comes to modern Czech literature) historical events and social changes had a direct impact on the quality of literary life and its products. In the nearly one hundred years since the establishment of the independent Czechoslovak state we can identify several periods, each of which tended to last for about twenty years each. Defined by changes in the political landscape, each of them likewise offered distinctly different conditions for literary undertakings, reader reception, relations between the authorities and the creative individual. This study describes the forms and functions of art as reflected in the choice of topics and formal execution, as well as in the emergence of trends, covering interwar literature (1918â1938), post-February literature (1948â1968), Normalization era literature (1969â1989) and, most recently, post-November literature (1989âpresent).},

 abstract = {This article explores Witold Gombrowicz within the context of Argentine literature by focusing on a particular tradition, namely travel-writing. Travel-writing is a privileged realm to scrutinize the rhetorical strategies whereby Europeans have âotheredâ foreign cultures, a process raising questions about cultural encounters, otherness and national identity. The article compares Gombrowicz's depictions of Argentina as an âimmatureâ country, with those of another contemporary traveller, the Spanish philosopher JosÃ© Ortega y Gasset. Whereas Ortega y Gasset is traditionally given the role of cultural referee in a culture which is thought to be inferior or minor, Gombrowicz makes the effort to dissolve that authority, deconstructing the Europe/central cultures, Latin America/secondary cultures opposition.},

 abstract = {Scholars in various fields have started to embrace the digital humanities, but there has been a delay in involving undergraduates. Challenges such as unfamiliarity with applications, lack of understanding about the overall purpose of projects, and insufficient resources all contribute to creating a barrier between the digital humanities and students. However, collaboration between scholars and library staff can create new learning opportunities for students that allow them to see the value in digital approaches to pedagogy and view the humanities through new perspectives. This article outlines a collaborative effort between the University of Virginiaâs Slavic Department and Libraryâs Scholarsâ Lab to implement a digital humanities project in a pre-existing semester-long undergraduate culture course. In this project, students were asked to print and present to one another 3D objects representing Russia and then curate an exhibition of these objects. At the semesterâs end, the students reflected on the appropriateness of their objects as symbols of Russia, given their increased knowledge of Russian culture. We draw on research in cultural pedagogy and digital scholarship to offer a new way of interpreting and teaching cultural understanding.},

 abstract = {The paper considers the philosophical aspects of repetition in Gennadii Aigi's poetic texts. The author concludes that repetition in Aigi's works is of a non-numerical nature. Unlike the quantitative parameters of repetition, their non-numerical ability to correspond to the entire poetic text is of major importance. In this regard, repetition manifests itself as a structure that reminds a fractal. The cornerstone of Aigi's repetitions is a cyclic model of time that is impossible to describe in terms of evolution and memory. Repetitions accumulate nothing: topics and ideas do not grow from each other, but rather grow into each other forming the general poetic unity. Repetitions in Aigi's poetry constitute a non-communicative phenomenon that is not associated with imitation and mimesis.},

This paper argues that the motifs form an all-pervasive subtext, especially in the Russian period. When examining EurydiceÊ¼s function in the constellation âOrpheus and Eurydiceâ, one sees that many female characters in NabokovÊ¼s fiction have shouldered her task of confronting her beloved with the issue of loss and retrieval, leaving him the choice of either futile replication of the past or creative transformation of it.

 abstract = {The crisis of values and reference points caused by the de-ideologization of the Soviet system in the late 1980s led to the elaboration and re-actualization of poetics, the revamping of avant-garde and post-avant-garde traditions, and focusing on formal rather than on semantic aspects. This approach can be seen as a consequence of the relativism of philosophical and ethical values in the last years of the Soviet Empire. An eloquent example of literary rehash in this period can be found in Bonifaceâs (G. Lukomnikovâs) minimalist work, wherein the question of the subject seems to be put aside in favour of a demonstration of poetic technique. This approach to the literary work avoids description of reality and speculation on categories of which the narrator cannot be sure. Hence, the poemâs phenomenological reality is restricted to the most habitual and mundane objects, and one of its most widely used techniques turns out to be appropriation, because of the unquestionable authority and historical verifiability of sources from the past. Predecessorsâ arguments are substituted for the authorâs own thoughts and feelings, but, paradoxically, it is mainly through the manipulation and selection of the tradition to which they refer that poets can express themselves.},

The first part looks at graffiti as a social behavior, which was considered âdeviantâ in the Soviet-era and which still bears that legacy in contemporary Russia. The second part examines graffiti and film as intermedial art practices that problematize the boundaries of artistic forms, and it investigates the implications of remediating graffiti. The article suggests that the graffiti collectiveâs practice of asking zachem, why, in the public sphere is a methodology that it extends to its own creative practices.},

It argues that literary decadence, which has been defined by fears about civilizational collapse, also encompasses anxieties about environmental collapse, which comprises the discourse of terrestrial decadence. At stake is not only a revision of the scope of a literary movement; I also suggest that this discourse of terrestrial decadence troubles the binary of culture and nature on which the edifice of modernity rests.},

 abstract = {Based on previously published articles dealing with the outer and inner space in Bohumil Hrabal's novel Harlequin's Millions, this study is devoted to the phenomenon of âthe witnesses of (good) old timesâ who, as characters, occupy a great deal of the narration, yet are simultaneously a purely surrealistic illusion within the fictional world. The theoretical point of departure is perception, embedded in the wider scope of consciousness and motion (kinetics). Thus, within the narration, a special form of perception arises, oscillating between the purely sensory perception of the witnesses and their being conceived of as mental images, despite their real life actions as characters in the novel's narration. Hrabal himself ironically designated the novel as âa fairy taleâ, thereby intentionally questioning the degree of truthfulness of this highly biographical fiction.},

 abstract = {As he did with several of his dramas, Fedor Sologub prefaced Pobeda smerti (1908) with a note indicating a text that supposedly influenced his work, in this case Potanin's VostoÄnye motivy v srednevekovom evropejskom Äpose. A close reading of Sologub's note, however, reveals that it is deceptively worded and in fact does not link Pobeda smerti with Potanin's book; by the same token a reading of both works reveals almost no similarities. Archival drafts of Pobeda smerti show that Sologub considered mentioning contemporary literary sources in his note, namely Blok's Korol' na ploÅ¡Äadi and Przybyszewski's VeÄnaja skazka, both of which frequently echo throughout Pobeda smerti. Sologub's drama takes issue with these well-known works' treatment of the relationships among the poet, the Eternal Feminine, and masses, and can be considered a âcorrectionâ of each. Whereas for Przybyszewski the Symbolist ideal is achieved by the end of the work, and for Blok the search for it is hopeless, even dangerous folly, Sologub returns to the standard modernist paradigm, convinced the ideal exists but that she has yet to be discovered by a human world unable to see her and what she represents.},

 abstract = {Andrei Bitov's âMan in Landscapeâ uses two motifs from Revelation to trace the narrator's relationship to his divine origin: reptilian beasts and the interplay of light and dark. The apocalyptic animals, coupled with the hero's passages from light into darkness and from darkness into light, explicate the narrator's pilgrim's progress from spiritual blindness to a life-giving epiphany. The narrator is led through two days of drunken wanderings by a painter who projects his own frailties onto God; he finally recognizes his blasphemy and flees the artist's apartment, later, like John of Patmos, to provide a record of his revelation.},

Akhmatova, in this schema, quite literally represents the bridge from post-Stalinist culture to pre-Revolutionary silver Age. The ironic stance adopted toward Akhmatova in Bitov's novel Pushkin House, as well as in the autobiographical note on Bitov's real-life meetings with Akhmatova, is dropped in Bitov's Reminiscences about Pushkin. In this last work, Bitov adopts strategies similar to those employed by Akhmatova in his essays on Pushkin, whom she views not only as her great predecessor in Russian poetry, but also as her âcontemporaryâ.},

 abstract = {Heinrich von Kleist was a poet who in several respects inspired Boris Pasternak, which has been denied by most of the critics. Before becoming a poet himself, Pasternak in 1911 anticipated the decision he took two years later and also his conception of realism of the 1940s, when describing the life of the German poet living in the age of romanticism. In an essay of 1941 the life of Kleist served as a parallel to his own life as well. Although his translations of Kleist's plays were primarily made on demand, in two cases he, similar to the case of the Hamlet translation, succeeded to conceal in them his own thoughts when reviewing them in the late 1930s, using the translation as mimicry (S. Witt). Last but not least, Kleistian intertext and autointertext concerning his own essays on Kleist serve as a means of remembering his own beginnings as a poet.},

 abstract = {The article analyzes an essay by Galina Kuznetsova, Buninâs disciple and mistress, entitled âMaria Bashkirtsevaâ, about the nineteenth-century Russian Ã©migrÃ©e to France whose journal became famous. The essay was discovered in the Paris Ã©migrÃ© newspaper ÐÐ¾ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´Ð½Ð¸Ðµ Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸ (Latest News) and has not been recorded before in any bibliographical source. We reveal a veiled motive for the essay to have been the âfatal duelâ beginning between the aging writer and his young protÃ©gÃ©e, who developed the essay in tentative opposition to Buninâs opinion about its heroine and her work and, later, implicitly challenged Bunin by demonstrating womenâs right to manifest their identity without being bound by traditional norms of behaviour. In time, thanks to Kuznetsova, Bunin would change his opinion on Bashkirtseva. The essay recalls Russian emigration in the twentieth century: nostalgia, the difficulties of adjusting to a foreign life and culture, and the sometimes tragic efforts made to maintain oneâs identity. The authors decipher the subtext of Kuznetsovaâs essay, examining its complex meanings, its audiences, from Bunin himself to the wider Ã©migrÃ© community, and the significance of Kuznetsovaâs choice to publish in the Ã©migrÃ© newspaper. The full text of G. N. Kuznetsovaâs essay âMaria Bashkirtsevaâ is provided in the Appendix.},

 abstract = {Hardly any figure in Andrei BelyiÊ¼s Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD) is mentioned more often than the Apostle Paul. BelyiÊ¼s late philosophical treatise often, whether directly or indirectly, refers to the person and work of the Apostle. Ranging from biographical concerns and Pauline thinking to BelyiÊ¼s adoption of the Pauline writings, a multifaceted preoccupation with the person of the so-called apostle to the gentiles can be observed throughout ISSD and BelyiÊ¼s oeuvre. This article aims to chart the stages of BelyiÊ¼s relationship with Paul, and to indicate the parallels he draws between his life and work as prophet of the new Christianity and his own biography, which leads him to describe the Apostle as the first bearer of what he terms the (Self-)Consciousness Soul.},

 abstract = {Andrei BelyiÊ¼s interpretation of Kant in Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD) is the focus of this article. Belyi sees the main manifestation of the Self-consciousness Soul in the fact that Kant constructed his philosophical system solely out of his own resources without adhering to tradition, as well as in the âingeniousâ question âHow is pure science of nature possible?â But Belyi harshly criticises the abstraction and subjectivity of KantÊ¼s theory of knowledge together with its limited solutions, as they do not take the development of humanity into consideration. Nevertheless, he highlights a way to facilitate a breakthrough to self-awareness within KantÊ¼s practical philosophy, and identifies the imperative character of practical reason with the power of the Self-consciousness Soul. He believes the Kantian âschemeâ to be the true aim of knowledge, an aim which the philosopher himself had not adequately managed to realise. In BelyiÊ¼s theory of cognition, KantÊ¼s scheme is of fundamental importance. He transforms it into a dynamic concept, an âimaginative notionâ identified with GoetheÊ¼s concept of prototype.},

It examines the opinions on various aspects of RozanovÊ¼s experimental narrative expressed by such leading literary personalities as Viktor Shklovskii, Viktor Khovin, Aleksei Remizov, Dmitrii Sviatopolk-Mirskii, Erikh Gollerbakh and Konstantin MochulÊ¼skii on one hand, and views by Lev Trotskii on the other. The aim is to create a representative typology of those opinions and interpretations which can be viewed as main trends of critical thought of the 1920s. The trends which in this decade mark the beginnings of the specificity of Russian culture in emigration still show aspects of homogeneity with intellectual thought inside Russia.},

Rather, it aligned with the utopian vision of harmonious coexistence between humans and animals characteristic for many personalities of Russian Futurism.

 abstract = {The literary rogue provides a focal point for society's discontents; he is a protean figure who shifts his shape to reflect the immediate concerns of his day. As a result, the shape of the literary work he inhabits also changes from one age to the next and often manifests generic hybridity. This article examines two Soviet-era literary protagonists, Pavel Korchagin (How the Steel Was Tempered) and Ivan Chonkin (The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin), and suggests that each is a compound of romance and picaresque features and that each is, accordingly, more similar to the other than has hitherto been suspected. Additionally, the article posits that one of the reasons why scholars have not considered similarities between the two characters is that How the Steel Was Tempered is modally inflected by tragedy, while Chonkin is comic.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the work of two poets of the late Soviet period, Oleg Grigorâev and Vsevolod Nekrasov, who were both employed in some capacity in official Soviet childrenâs literature while writing âadultâ poetry that remained unpublished. As unofficial writers nevertheless employed in the Soviet literary system, Grigorâev and Nekrasov negotiated a complicated relationship with Soviet literature both contemporary and historical, both childrenâs and âadultâ. This circumstance is reflected in the presence of a childlike aesthetic, evident in elements like alogism, naivetÃ©, nonsense and other inventive wordplay, in their work. To some extent, Grigorâev and Nekrasov were drawing on the experience of predecessors like the OBERIU poets and the legacy of early Soviet childrenâs literature. In their unofficial work, they were also making creative use of the conventional features of childrenâs poetry in obviously non-childlike contexts. Indeed, the childlike aesthetic could be more evident in their adult poetry than childrenâs, blurring and calling into question these generic divisions. I demonstrate this deliberate ambiguity through a comparison of their adult and childrenâs work, and suggest that the evocation of the childlike in adult work, as well as the blurring of boundaries between genres, functioned as a rhetorical gesture marking texts as implicitly oppositional to official Soviet aesthetics.},

@article{MRUGALSKI202185,
 abstract = {In this paper, I present theoretical assumptions behind Teoria/Literatura, a multifaceted digital research and publishing project on 20th-century Polish literary thought. The point of departure is the conjecture that the tensions between the digital and the humanistic in present-day DH help bring out in full relief the cardinal conflict line in Polish literary theory â between formalism/structuralism on the one hand and phenomenology on the other. Conversely, the order of concepts in the corpus of Polish literary theory enables the researcher to pinpoint the relation of the humanistic and the digital (or formalist) within DH so that it might be challenged and/or upgraded. In the first section, I provide an overview of the project's strata and its wide-ranging goal, i.e., a corpus of Polish literary theory. In section two, I examine the way in which the structure of the corpus can help elucidate the general problem of the relation between the digital and the humanistic in DH. Specifically, I relate this issue to the quarrel in constructive mathematics between mathematical intuitionism and formalism. The third section is devoted to a synecdochal representation of the general problem of the duality of intuitionism and formalism â the visualisation of narrative temporality.},

And more specifically: If the artist is free to create, how is his or her subjective creativity not arbitrary? The article argues against the purely aesthetic approach to Nabokov as well as against the metaphysical one and links Nabokov's aesthetic views with those of Kant, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, which, in the end, provides the hermeneutic key for reading the short story in question.},

In its disturbing lack of obvious political or emotional relevance to the socialist experience, the grand spectacle of adultery and suicide on the country's main dramatic stage prompted a conflicted critical construction of the play's Soviet meaning and resonance. Situating Anna Karenina in contemporary political and cultural landscapes, this essay exposes and interprets the rupture between the production's mediated publicized image and immediate theatrical actuality, and brings to light the play's inherent logic and implications created through a uniquely theatrical exchange among the Stalinist state, stage, and audience.},

 abstract = {This study entwines two literary and two philosophical goals. The first literary aim is to dispel the enduring paradigm in Chekhov studies presenting this writer as a brainless virtuoso, who writes artistically brilliant works that lack idea(l)s. The second is to examine ChekhovÊ¼s poetics of contrariety, and illustrate it with an analysis of the short story âDreamsâ (âMechtyâ). Behind these two literary tasks loom two philosophical issues. First, the oxymoron of the brainless virtuoso is rooted in the fact that a great part of Chekhov criticism has been in the wake of Cartesian rationalism, which postulates that theoretical thinking precedes practical living. Since Chekhov writes in the phenomenological tradition grounded on the premise that practical living precedes theoretical thinking, interpreting him along rationalist lines is questionable. And, second, the poetics of contrariety is a partial attempt to develop a more adequate, phenomenological literary approach to certain pivotal aspects of the Chekhov oeuvre.},

 abstract = {This article describes a handwritten newspaper, Tsentro-Gidra (Central Hydra), published in June 1918 by inmates in Taganskaya prison. The newspaper reflected the tastes and interests of Moscow lawyers, who had been arrested at a Constitutional Democrats party meeting, and of military officers who belonged to the underground organisation âUnion for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedomâ, which aimed to overthrow the Bolshevik regime. The newspaperâs apparent founder, editor-in-chief and main author, A. Vilenkin, united both groups, being both a lawyer and a military officer. The content of the newspaper shows that the Anti-Bolshevik union was formed from people with opposite political views. The poems published in the paper could be called manifestos of this association. The paper reflects how the mood of this group of prisoners, and likely that of the greater part of society which they represented, was changing. The article provides information about the authors and all others mentioned in the paper, all but one of whom were prisoners in Taganskaya in June 1918. The style of Tsentro-Gidra reveals how they viewed the historic moment as well as their own position. Realia depicted in the newspaper show how ideas and prison life were changing at the time.},

@article{NAZARENKO2006285,
 abstract = {Pictographic writing, which has been used for conveying utilitarian messages for millennia is typically considered unsuitable for rendering poetic metaphoric and abstract images. Hence a strong belief that poetry cannot be produced using pictographic signs. This assumption was challenged by the Russian Constructivists, Aleksej ÄiÄerin and Äl' Lisickij in the 1920s. Recently, pictographic poetry has been successfully developed by the leading Russian visual poets, Rea Nikonova and Sergej Sigej, whose literary and artistic works demonstrate a notable congruence with the early Russian avant-garde experiments. This study analyzes selected pictographic poems written by Nikonova and Sigej from the 1970s until the present. Originally appearing in manuscript form, limited editions, and small circulation journals, most of these poems are unknown to scholars and the general public. The paper explores the strategies and techniques developed by Nikonova and Sigej for rendering notions, ideas and concepts by pictographic signs. It is demonstrated that Nikonova's and Sigej's pictographic poems vary considerably in the degree of their abstraction and potential for multiple interpretations, a feature totally absent from the first utilitarian pictographic texts. Therefore, the semantics of their works is dependent on the reader's interpretation of graphic and contextual clues. As Sigej's and Nikonova's works demonstrate, understanding contemporary pictographic poetry requires the reader's readiness to be engaged in the hermeneutic game, to manipulate various contexts in order to construct meaning, thus transforming the reader into a co-author.},

 abstract = {The paper addresses Pasternak's negative attitude towards libertinism by pointing out the significant role assigned to the caricaturesque libertin Viktor Komarovskii in the novel Doktor Zhivago. Since it is Komarovskii who triggers a good deal of the plot, he is all but a secondary character. His libertinism, then, consists not so much in excess as in taking control over others' lives. On the other hand, there are unmistakably libertinist traits in the conduct of Iurii Zhivago, Pasternak's anti-libertinist protagonist. Moreover, Zhivago criticizes the asceticism of the revolutionary Pavel Antipov-Strel'nikov as rationalist and heartless. While using Hans Jonas' typology of libertinism and asceticism as just two ways of âcontempt for the worldâ, the paper aims to conceptualize Zhivago's third position of openness and gratitude.},

This article takes Tolokonnikovaâs statement as a starting point and explores the ways in which Pavlenskiiâs artistic practice both conforms with, and deviates from the model for art activism employed by Voina, Pussy Riot, and other political art collectives in contemporary Russia, including Kollektivnye deistviia, Ekspropriatsiia territorii iskusstva, Oleg Kulik, and Chto delatâ, among others. The author finds that Pavlenskiiâs work largely conforms to the style of his predecessors in terms of locale, political sentiment and reasoning, but diverges from these models in its tone, brutality, and premeditated use of state power as an artistic medium.},

 abstract = {Moscow conceptualism was the most important Russian art movement of the late twentieth century, and Dmitrii Prigov is usually identified as one of its major proponents. Yet the most significant aspect of Russian conceptualism â its verbal texts â has received less attention from critics than merited. This is particularly noticeable in critical approaches to the work of Prigov, who objected to the term conceptualism, criticized the dominant literary model for unofficial pictorial art, and insisted on the equivalence of his visual and verbal works. Such assertions make clear the need for a cross-disciplinary approach to encompass both the visuality of Prigov's verbal creations and the textuality of his pictorial works. A critical approach that discusses Prigov's work in the more congenial context of postmodern art helps avoid the outdated model of the poet as a lonely artist defending an unassailable truth that Prigov himself rejected. Prigov emphasized the importance of the pictorial arts in his transition away from the reigning âarchaic, frozen cultural atmosphereâ that produced an artistic ideal more âtypical of Russian literature from the 19th centuryâ than appropriate to late-Soviet reality. To honour Prigov's recognition of that dilemma and to account for his assertion that in his work the visual and the verbal are âodna kashaâ, we must focus first on his multivalent word and its collusion in an on-going conversation about art.},

 abstract = {The article explores the representation of St. Petersburg in 18th-century Russian panegyric literature from the point of view of rhetorical topoi. The ancient and humanistic tradition of laus urbis provided established categories for the conceptualisation of the new capital that were first adapted by Gavriil Buzhinskii and Feofan Prokopovich. Following the development of specific St. Petersburg topoi in the 18th century the paper focuses on the perception of urban space both in panegyric literature and visual art. It shows how the point of view in the description of the city changes from Lomonosov's encomiastic prose and Makhaev's lithographies to Derzhavin's odes and Quarenghi's aquarelles.},

 abstract = {This paper is devoted to two poets of the 1920s, Aleksandr Chachikov and Sergei Tret'iakov. An important theme in the work of both is the East, and especially anti-colonialism and liberation. This theme ranges from Egypt, via India, to China. In Chachikov's poems the emphasis is on the exotic element, whereas Tret'iakov, perhaps not surprisingly, is straightforwardly political in his work about China. A remarkable aspect of both is that the abundant use of foreign words and names recalls the sound experiments of the Avant-Garde.},

 abstract = {This essay traces the diverse sources and fates of the pursuit of laughter in Sergei ProkofÊ¼evÊ¼s first full-length opera The Love for Three Oranges (1921) â arguably the composerÊ¼s only pronounced take on modernism. Conceived and composed during the turbulent times of war and exile, the opera at once harked back to the pre-revolutionary Petersburg theater suffused with historical homage, and leaped forward to the amnesiac ebullience of the interwar modernist stage. In a series of examples, I demonstrate ProkofÊ¼evÊ¼s distinctive ways of generating comedy, the multi-media techniques that allowed, even if for a brief while, for a happy marriage between modernism and the up-and-coming Soviet âculture industryâ.},

 abstract = {Throughout history Stepan Razin was the hero in numerous oral and written stories, composed at different times and in different places. This wealth of material allows us to reconstruct the formation of his legend, both in literature and in folklore. The contemporary or near contemporary responses to the uprising led by Razin, and to his captivity and execution, show how âprimaryâ historical sources were tacitly shaped and reshaped by tradition and popular imagination, which privileged certain types of narratives. Among the latter, âdemonologicalâ and âapocalypticâ models take a prominent place. Therefore we have two types of folk narratives: in the first, Razin the brigand is successful because, in fact, he is a sorcerer, and that defines his destiny in this and in the other world (Razin as a âwalking deadâ, his ghost still watching over hidden treasures etc.). In the second, Razinâs posthumous existence is intertwined with eschatologies either as future savior who will prevent the worldâs destruction (the positive pattern), or as a great sinner who awaits Last Judgment, sometimes even as the destroyer of the world (the negative pattern). Both âdemonologicalâ and âapocalypticâ models of interpretation are absent in literary versions of Razinâs story, or evoked only as âpopular beliefsâ and superstitions. The authors of historical novels attempt to rationalize the heroâs âmagicalâ abilities and attribute his power to his strong personality or even to his âmagneticâ qualities. Still, these authors walk a thin line between historical ârealityâ and metaphor, particularly when they touch upon subjects such as âlove-magicâ when Razin falls under the spell of a woman, even if only in the metaphorical sense.},

The novels clearly evoke the thesis of a binary impulsion in the dynamics of Russian culture, proposed by the Moscow-Tartu school of semiotics. In this article I argue that Pelevin, on both a stylistic and thematic level, dwells consciously on famous (cultural) semiotic notions of duality and in many cases subjects them to postmodernist deconstruction and irony.},

He began working for the Bolsheviks during the Civil War in Ukraine, moved to Moscow in 1922, and worked for major Soviet publications until 1991. His work, as the article posits, helped to define Soviet visual culture and with it a form of visual Occidentalism. At the same time, EfimovÊ¼s cartoons illustrate the connections between Soviet visual culture and Soviet power. Again and again, his caricatures were held up to be examples of how Soviet citizens needed to forge a new sense of self through the âhealthy laughterâ they provoked at the expense of state enemies. The Soviet caricature, the article concludes, therefore served as a powerful weapon in the stateÊ¼s arsenal. No one wielded it more consistently than Boris Efimov.},

This can be the personified story itself (âthe story went into an unknown directionâ) or a hero from whose point of view the story is told. These devices make it possible to alternate points of view (inside and outside), to describe the past as something that is taking place in front of our eyes, or the future as something that has already happened.},

The writer used the strategy of âsymbolizationâ to interpret anthroposophy along symbolic lines, and vice versa. In Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD), the strategy of âsymbolizationâ was aimed at an ambitious anthroposopho-symbolist interpretation of European cultural history. It also governed the invention of a series of neologisms. In contrast, in the Stalinist epoch the strategy of âsymbolizationâ helped to unite anthroposophical ideas with the Marxist terminological system.},

Without ending the Great Purge, the Communist Party, hypocritically, called for its repressions to be stopped and innocent people to be rehabilitated. This campaign was described in the story âThe Rehabilitationâ by the avant-garde writer Daniil Kharms. The article also deals with the propaganda campaign that began in the Soviet periodical press in August-September 1940. This was triggered by V. Molotovâs report in which, envisaging the development of the Second World War, he summoned Soviet citizens to âreadiness for mobilizationâ. In literature, it stipulated the governmentâs order to depict virtuous and heroic characters. The âreadiness for mobilizationâ idea explains the criticism of A. Avdeenko for his partiality to negative characters and of A. Akhmatova for her lyric poems.},

Even at the most critical moments of history, Rechâ consistently paid attention to literature, theater, architecture, painting, science and education. With its wide scope of cultural news, Rechâ was âone of the most important liberal organs in the Russian periodical press systemâ, according to contemporary researchers, and remained its most representative and progressive socio-political publication. Now, a century later, the Rechâ newspaper deserves recognition as a very important source for the comprehensive study of its period, since it represented a force that in the years 1917â18 prevented the premature death of culture.},

It shows the crucial role these words play in the poem's structure and intertextuality, in particular, in its references to texts by Lev Tolstoi, Ivan Goncharov and Aleksandr Pushkin. The consistent lack of such keywords in the translations may account for the failure of an indisputable gem of Russian poetry to claim its due place in the world literary canon.},

The purpose of this article is to clarify the meaning he invests in this term, as well as to determine its place in his work. BelyiÊ¼s references to the teachings of Husserl are considered, and a parallel is drawn with FregeÊ¼s conception of logic. The emphasis placed by Belyi on the precision of knowledge is demonstrated by his use of a particular metaphor: while Frege uses the metaphor of âa microscopeâ, Belyi uses that of both âa microscope and a telescopeâ.},

During the Soviet period women engaged in political chastushki, which combine both types of humor. These could be either subversive and underground (and could lead to arrest) or official and used for reeducation. In the post-Soviet period, elder rural women demonstrated their attunement to both of these Soviet contexts. The community quality of the chastushka form and its context, the public village forum, held out the promise of safety. Political chastushki helped women construct a social identity with a distinct public voice.},

 abstract = {This article is focused on the work of Genrikh Sapgir, an outstanding Russian poet of the late twentieth century. It examines the evolution of his poetics, considered in relation to narrative subjectivity and its mutability in his poems. As a young poet, Sapgir openly announced his rejection of a strong authorial position in the text, effectively turning the author into a âfunction,â merely relaying âalienâ voices without changing them significantly (as can be observed in his book, Voices). However, since the late 1980s, the poet began to move towards a more pronounced subjectivity. Eventually, he reneged on his earlier convictions and returned to a position where the author becomes the single omnipotent subject of the poetic utterance. However, this evolution was far from linear, and reveals a number of deviations and various hybrid forms. For instance, Sapgirâs book, Pushkinâs Notebooks, features a double subject, whereas his Monologues are concerned with mutable subjectivity. In turn, his book, Tactile Instruments, rejects the principle of âlyrical narrationâ altogether, calling its readers to concrete action by means of verbal address. This effectively divides the subject into two hypostases â one that speaks and another that acts.},

 abstract = {This article attempts to give a detailed analysis of the poem, which has been only partially examined in the existing criticism. Throughout the poem four incompatible conceptions of God and man collide without merging with each other: the poet tells about the loving Father and humble, grateful man; about the incomprehensible Origin of All and of stoical acceptance of the world which man cannot change; about hostile despotic Force and man's rebellion against It; and finally, about the illusive nature of the very notion of God and of the resulting meaninglessness of human existence. The article proceeds by tracing these four concepts, which are not presented consecutively but interweave sometimes in one and the same stanza, if not in the same line. Some attention is given to comparing and contrasting the poem with Derzhavin's âBogâ and âReka vremen v svoem stremlen'iâ, Pushkin's âProrokâ and âDar naprasnyi, dar sluchainyiâ, and Lermontov's âProrokâ and âBlagodarnost", as well as with Ivan Karamazov's ârebellionâ.},

One path towards these goals was by modeling the poem after the nineteenth-century novel; Pound viewed this âprose traditionâ of poetry as a means of restraining self-expression. Both Akhmatova and Eliot exemplify this approach, utilizing Tolstoyan techniques and emphasizing body language in order to concisely imply an untold narrative, indirectly disclose emotion, and temper the expression of the self.},

The present paper offers an unorthodox explanation for this by identifying the avant-garde's contract with the reader, which promotes the writer as a prophetic genius, while demanding abeyance and worship from the reader, offering him/her masochistic pleasure. Mainstream avant-garde scholarship, in its turn, certifies the avant-garde's claims as its true essence and markets its product as exceptional. These pressures create a dilemma for contemporary scholars. Choosing the co-opted approach elevates further the rating of the avant-garde, avant-garde studies and the scholar's own work, but means engaging in mythmaking, whereas choosing a nonco-opted reading reduces the value of the avant-garde and the scholar, generating accusations by mainstream critics of a non-scholarly attitude toward the subject.},

 abstract = {The paper considers sex and gender issues underlying Mikhail Kuzminâs longer poem âThe Trout Breaks the Iceâ. In the Russian literary canon, Kuzmin has not obtained the high status he deserves because his openly gay writings are not acceptable either under homophobic Soviet law or by todayâs official anti-LGBT Russian mindset. Interestingly, despite the poetâs notorious reputation, the homosexual core of âThe Troutâ has been consistently ignored in most critical analyses. Nor has the other side of Kuzminâs homosexuality, his misogynism â also an important part of âThe Troutâ â been discussed so far. Dissolved in rich intertextuality, symbols and rhetoric, it is responsible for the ambivalent portrayal of the heroine. She is a Psyche who patronizes the love between the two male protagonists but also a femme fatale who drives one of them, who becomes her lover, to death. Women were avenged later, in Anna Akhmatovaâs âPoem without a Heroâ, a tribute to her 1920s romance with Olâga Glebova-Sudeikina, which was inspired literarily by a rivalry with Kuzmin, especially his âTroutâ. The poetessâ inherent Lesbian agenda led to a covert reworking of Kuzminâs gay poetics, which was programmatically open about homosexual love being more rewarding and less tragic than heterosexual love. As the âPoemâs hidden real message has been ignored even by scholars for fear of diminishing Akhmatovaâs reputation, âThe Poemâ succeeded in eclipsing Kuzminâs more genuine and artistically daring portrayal of bisexual triangular love that flourished in the Silver Age.},

The Introduction outlines Herzen's efforts to turn intimate life into a historical narrative by way of literary structures, which were underwritten by Hegelian philosophical paradigms. The introduction tells the story of the love affair itself, focusing on the convergence of the intimate and the historical. It also describes how the story of the family drama was written and published, between 1852 and 2001, by Herzen, members of his immediate circle, and distant scholars, some of whom became emotionally involved in the Herzen family drama. Paperno argues that, in the end, the story of the Herzen family drama turned into a paradigmatic text, or institution, of Russian intelligentsia culture: the intimacy-history connection became both publicly observable and reproducible.},

Khodasevichâs poems in âEuropean Nightâ, marked with the dates and place of composition, and implicitly iterative of the contours of a Europe with which his original Ã©migrÃ© audience was intimately familiar, represent both an autobiographical narrative and a cartographic attempt to sketch a conceptual map of European exile. Using four visualizations of the coordinates of Khodasevichâs travel, composition, place, and publication to investigate the poetâs experience and literary output in Europe during these years, I argue that the force of geography on literary production (literature in space) was especially active between 1922 and 1927.

In order to trace this complex relationship in Mandel'shtam's poetics, the article first looks at Walter Benjamin's incisive critique of historicism with which Mandel'shtam's quintessentially modernist poetics of time shares many affinities. Like Benjamin, Mandel'shtam was sympathetic to the revolution's utopian promise of temporal transformation and release from the empty time of linear history. It did not take him long, however, to realize a radical difference between his own and the Bolsheviks' view of history; much as he tried throughout the 1920s, he failed to bring the two into any kind of alignment. The article argues that passages where Mandel'shtam is at his most revealing about temporality and history also implicitly critique the official pretension of mastery over time: time always strikes back with a vengeance, and it is only through its momentary suspension in shocks that one can begin to comprehend its structure.},

 abstract = {The article proposes examining Konstantin VaginovÊ¼s best-known novel as an experiment in the allegorical reading of Soviet modernity. Analysed to date mainly as a work of metafiction, Trudy i dni Svistonova can be profitably approached in the light of what Walter Benjamin saw as a radical revalorization of allegory in modernism. It is the allegorical mode that denies death and time by mortifying its object. Such a form of writing is well formulated in BaudelaireÊ¼s âspleen et idÃ©alâ from Fleurs du mal, the book which, by VaginovÊ¼s own admission, gave him the strongest push to start writing poetry of his own. The article argues that the allegorical mode informs much of VaginovÊ¼s poetry and even more so, his prose which is still understudied, particularly when it comes to situating it within the context of European modernism. According to Walter Benjamin, BaudelaireÊ¼s allegory had the powerful ability to unmask the bourgeois order, with its illusion of totality and organic wholeness. VaginovÊ¼s weapon of preference against the newly minted faÃ§ade of the Stalinist order, complete with its metaphysics of time and history, is exactly the same one that both Baudelaire and Benjamin directed against the faÃ§ades of their own worlds. To Vaginov, writing historically means writing allegorically; it means petrifying trembling actuality which then becomes a tomb that writes and to which the writing subject is also sacrificed.},

Many of PlatonovÊ¼s writings composed for publication after the advent of Socialist Realism are equally concerned with time, temporality, and history, even though one needs to look beyond their more conventional narratives to identify these concerns. Focusing on two representative texts from the late 1930s, the article examines ways in which PlatonovÊ¼s âSocialist Realistâ oeuvre collides with StalinismÊ¼s understanding of time. It argues that PlatonovÊ¼s use of allegory in stories meant to fit the grid of the Socialist Realist method subtly advances a notion of history vastly different from the one on which the Stalinist master narrative is based.},

These are linked to Buddhist principles and to works by such predecessors as Vasilisk Gnedov and Ivan Ignatiev, and his contemporary Ry Nikonova. The article discusses and introduces some aspects of works by Kondratov published in the present issue, notably with regard to typographical particularities.},

Taking the Platonic idiosyncrasy towards poetry and the State (âRepublicâ) as its dialectical departure point, the substance and matter of the volume encompasses several characteristic case studies which appear to be highly relevant in this context. This special issue deals with the oeuvre of such iconic Russian poets as Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Maiakovskii, Daniil Kharms, Dmitrii Prigov, Arkadii Dragomoschenko and many others. Special attention is paid to the general issue of ideology and the Russian Avant-Garde pragmatics of shocking action related to Futurism and early Soviet culture.},

 abstract = {The work of Arkadii Dragomoshchenko, one of the most prominent Russian poets of his generation, is, on the face of it, supremely apolitical. Compared to many of his peers, not to mention younger poets, he hardly ever spoke on political matters; his poetry is even less concerned with politics. And yet, there is every reason to believe that the politics of his poetics is nothing short of revolutionary. This follows directly from Dragomoshchenkoâs conviction that language cannot be appropriated and that any claim to language is laughable by definition as it always proceeds through âan idealistic repression of difference and desire in the name of law and equationâ (âTam. To. Togdaâ, 1999). This conviction also underlies his own unique strategy of political resistance which he once described as âresisting the weatherâ. The article attempts to explicate the politics of Dragomoshchenkoâs poetry and the ethical consequences of his political strategy through a close reading of his poem âPolitikuâ (âTo a Statesmanâ) and several other texts included in his last poetry collection Tavtologiia (Tautology).},

 abstract = {The spectrum of possible lyric subjects in the poetry of Boniface/Lukomnikov is fairly wide. It ranges from âsubjectlessâ poetry to a set of different poetic masks, including lyrical forms in which the obvious literary prototype of the subject is the biographical author himself. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the lyric subject, we can talk about its integrity, which is created through the playful poetic manner of Boniface/Lukomnikov. The wholeness of the subject is achieved by means of the performative and visual objectification of the character, which is immediately recognized by the readers and replicated by the author, the authorâs interpreters (e.g. illustrators), and other âagentsâ of the literary image. This is particularly noticeable in Boniface/Lukomnikovâs minimalistic texts, which do not provide enough capacity for the poetic subject to be fully expressed: therefore, the subject is presented through small details and additional meanings, which appear when the author promotes a text written by someone else as his own (a non-reductive, structural type of minimalism), or claims extremely small literary forms as poetry (a reductive, materialistic type of minimalism).},

 abstract = {Within literary comparative studies, inquiries into typological connections represent a markedly high level, primarily because the principle of comparing phenomena can be applied in its full spectrum, which includes dissimilarities. An overarching central European climate becomes clearly apparent when comparing the Czech and Slovak poetry of the 1920s (e.g., BÅezina, HlavÃ¡Äek, Hviezdoslav, LukÃ¡Ä, NovomeskÃ½, Smrek, Toman, Wolker). Czech movements such as DevÄtsil and Poetismus ran alongside the Slovaks' poetic naÃ¯vetÃ©, not unlike its Czech counterparts and their socially-engaged lyrics, as this developmental relationship was fostered in large part by the union of both nations' literatures. Set against the backdrop of a wider context, including French and American poetry, as well as Russian prose, this paper traces the highly international niche established by the Czech and Slovak lyrical schools.},

It offers a general definition of the term âGothicâ in cultural history and a brief overview of the history of the Gothic mode in Russian and Soviet culture, as well as of treatments of the Russian and Soviet Gothic in scholarship. The authors note that the Gothic was late to take root in Russian cultural traditions, and speculate concerning the relationship between Gothic, as a mode that is concerned with the threatening resurgence in modern experience of archaic experience, with revolutionary social transformations and associated political discourses and social structures. The introduction concludes with preliminary remarks about each of the articles included in the cluster.},

 abstract = {The article centers on close readings of Iurii Tarichâs little studied film Wings of a Serf (1926) and the life and times of the archaeologist Ignatii Iakovlevich Stelletskii (1878â1949), who obsessively sought to discover the legendary library of Ivan the Terrible, thought to lie concealed beneath the Moscow Kremlin. These examples show the peculiar fascination of early Soviet audiences with the tsarist past in its most extreme expressions of violence and cruelty. The alluring, frightening early Soviet Ivan the Terrible demonstrates post-Revolutionary societyâs queasy sense that the excesses of the old regime threatened to reemerge in the new, Soviet era. The conclusion of the article considers how the Stalinist period, both in its unprecedented bloodshed and violence and in its positive myth of Ivan the Terrible as a great leader despite his cruelty, fulfilled this fearful anticipation in ways that could not have been foreseen in the 1920s. This macabre return of a superseded past undergirded the one Stalinist representation of Ivan to revisit the 1920s Gothic image of the tsar, Sergei Eisensteinâs ambivalent portrayal of despotic power and violence in his uncompleted film trilogy Ivan the Terrible (1942â1944).},

@article{PODLSNIK2019161,
 abstract = {Suicide has become an important factor in the mythologization of biographies of twentieth-century writers and poets: it was often interpreted in the context of authorsâ literary vocation, which meant that in the rough conditions of twentieth-century Russian history the link between the two frequently resulted in the interpretation of the authorâs suicide as his ultimate literary or creative act. The multiple suicides of (mostly modernist) poets in the first half of the century, therefore, had an immense mythogenic potential. This potential resonates in the interpretations of literary suicides in modern popular culture as well as in the interpretations of suicides by other writers. In the texts of historian, literary critic and writer Grigorii Chkhartishvili/Boris Akunin, an interesting new aspect of this tradition emerges. Chkhartishvili/Akunin tries to combine the demythologization of the scientific (rational) definition of the writerâs suicide with writing strategies that can be interpreted as the result of an almost superstitious fear of suicide as an imminent danger of real writing. This intricate combination of re- and demythologization offers an interpretative tool for analyzing Chkhartishviliâs/Akuninâs model of âstructuring his creative writingâ as well as his creation of multiple creative personalities and the meaning of their interrelations.},

In his poetic work he manages to redefine the limits between philosophy and art and to elaborate a new approach to some poignant philosophical problems.},

 abstract = {The paper explores the tight relation between âartâ and âimmortalityâ in Boris Pasternak's author's ideology on the basis of a newly found letter to his second wife Zinaida Nikolaevna Neigauz, written in the beginning of 1931. This letter, preserved only in a copy, sheds new light upon one of the most important points of the author's ideology. In this document, Pasternak explains his views on the unacceptability of suicide. The letter is closely related to his autobiographical work Safe Conduct, the final part of which was written soon after the suicide of Vladimir Maiakovskii. It is possible to draw a line from the letter to the novel Doctor Zhivago. The ends of two protagonists' lives, Iurii Zhivago and his antipode Pavel Antipov-Strelnikov, are compared. The main protagonist dies, leaving behind his poetry. For Pasternak, it is the way of continuation, âlife after deathâ, and the symbol of creative immortality of a poet. On the contrary, Antipov committed suicide, an end consistent with his life position.},

The cycle is constructed from variations on the images and motifs of predecessors, both poets and musicians, including Aleksandr Pushkin, Vasilii Zhukovskii, Apollon Maikov, Aleksandr Blok, and Petr Tchaikovskii and his Childrenâs Album. This analysis of the text â at the level of its lexical, rhythmic and syntactic features â demonstrates the profound convergence of music and poetry, the interweaving of literary and musical allusions, and the inclusion of contemporary experience into the course of history as basis for the creative transformation of the world in Pasternakâs poetics. With this analysis, we demonstrate why and how lyrical poetry functions as a key source for the reconstruction of the poetâs political, cultural-historical, conceptual, and spiritual views.},

Love makes it possible to enter the realm of beauty and to understand the infinity of the world. By writing poetry the poet perfects his own soul.

 abstract = {The article examines Grigorii Gukovskii's âstage theoryâ (especially presented in his works of the 1930s) in the context of its wide application to the Soviet school practice. The monographs by Gukovskii are compared with the texts of school textbooks of the end of the 1930s, made under strong influence of the âstage theoryâ. Gukovskii's activity as a professor of school teaching methodology is the subject of the second part of the article. In both parts the author reveals that Gukovskii tried to conciliate Soviet ideology in the field of literary criticism. He pretended to be an âarbiterâ between ideological and research schemes in literary analysis. At the school level his âstage theoryâ got out of its creator's control. The end of such a play with the Soviets was the death of the scholar.},

For Chekhov, intimate family relations are secured through a kind of healthy distance, where the remoteness separating siblings generates a mutuality maintained by important barriers. By examining the author's evocation of distance in these works, this essay seeks to explore Chekhov's understanding of the relation that defines us as both siblings and selves.},

Roman Jakobson's hypothesis consists in the transposition of literary features to cinematographic means, until reaching what the Russian formalists came to call the âPoetics of Cinemaâ (âPoÄtika Kinoâ). An overview of the relations that Jakobson maintained with the poets and painters of the Czech and Russian Avant-Garde, his attitude in film matters (movies, filmmakers), and the theoretical references that dealt with film questions are some of the themes discussed with the aim to contextualize the vision that Jakobson had of the cinematographic medium.},

The article brings Tretâiakovâs writing on photography and the ocherk, including his contributions to Sovetskoe foto, Pioner, and book-length collections featuring his photography, into dialogue with his contemporaries, especially Mikhail Prishvin and Leonid Leonov, and illustrates photographyâs shifting role in the codification of Socialist Realism. It suggests the expansive reach of Tretâiakovâs âoperative-eyeâ as a model practice beyond his death.},

 abstract = {This article is devoted to the phenomenon of fan fiction in its interaction with Russian classical literature. Traditionally, fan fiction is associated with products of mass culture â fantasy novels, TV-series, anime or comic books. The transformation of canonical literary texts by their creative fans is hardly a widespread practice. In Russia and the Russian-speaking world, where âgreat Russian literatureâ has sacred status and the classics are obligatory reading at secondary school, fan fiction based on classical texts is an especially exotic and shocking phenomenon. In this work I list the key characteristics of Russian-classics fan fiction, outline fan fiction writersâ most popular Russian classical texts â Eugene Onegin, War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, and Woe from Wit â and describe recurring narratives of fanfics: âcrossoversâ, âslashâ stories, and alternative endings. I also reveal a unique subgenre of fan fiction specific to Russian classical literature, which puts the original workâs author and his characters together into the same literary space. Further, I problematize the reverence given to literary classics in the Russian-speaking world, the secondary school experience, and their influence on the creative processes of fan fiction. From a series of in-depth interviews with fan fiction writers, I identify the emotional modes of âguiltâ, âresponsibilityâ and âchallengeâ that are typical of the Russian-classics fan fiction experience.},

Vasilii Kamenskii created the word farabanst, a combination of baraban and futurist. The second remarkable feature is the frequent occurrence of the number 7 in the texts of the futurists (Khlebnikov, Kamenskii, Kruchenykh, Maiakovskii). The number was often used to denote the futurist universe (there were seven representatives of Russian futurism).},

 abstract = {The article examines Sergei Sharshun's prose, with a particular focus on Put' pravyi (1934). EmigrÃ© critics interpreted this text in light of a testimonial, confessional genre reminiscent of the âhuman documentâ, which was prevalent during that time. The present analysis challenges this traditional reception by engaging with the novel's diverse, if implicit, intertexts, ranging from Dada and Surrealism to Soviet avant-garde writing, Art Deco, medieval myths, Shakespeare, Russian Modernism, and the physiological and necrophilic tendencies of Russian Ã©migrÃ© prose of the First Wave, as well as the Russian classical tradition. As a result, Sharshun's novel emerges as a highly original, playful, and subversive narrative created at the crossroads of a variety of discourses and literary models.},

Yet critics and scholars often analyze it primarily in terms of linguistic play and cultural relativism.

Even more than by his strictly textual creations, such digestion is endorsed by Sorokin's participation in the series of multimedial projects on which this analysis zeroes in: the photo album Deep Into Russia, the picture book Horse Soup, and the film Four.},

Thus, the term âconcrete metaphysicsâ (âkonkretnaia metafizikaâ), which is used by Florenskii in his most important work, U vodorazdelov mysli, is borrowed from Medtner's work Razmyshleniia o Gete, in which it is the equivalent of Goethe's term âDarstellungâ. Both Medtner and Florenskii, each from their own perspective, interpret the purpose and intent of philosophy, deriving from Socrates and Plato, as surprise and mystery. Despite the fact that Florenskii mentions Medtner only once in U vodorazdelov mysli, Medtner's ideas were important for significant parts of Florenskii's chapter âDialecticsâ and can be identified by a careful reading of both texts.},

Viewed in part as an instrument of foreign policy, InternatsionalÊ¼naia literatura operated far more independently than any other literary periodical of its day. Through careful manoeuvring and extensive correspondence with foreign writers and the Party elite, the editors of InternatsionalÊ¼naia literatura were able to hold off the pressures of centralisation and cultural isolationism for significantly longer than was possible in relation to domestic literature.},

 abstract = {This article, which functions as a stand-alone analysis but also introduces this volume's cluster devoted to pop-cultural literary practices, highlights the possibilities and perspectives of an approach that puts the reader at the center of research on Russian-language literary practices and texts. The author focuses primarily on texts related to popular culture, but she also reflects on the contemporary reception of Russian classics and new novels. Drawing upon her experiences as researcher of online Russian-language literary communities that focus on fan fiction and manga, the author argues for methodologies that combine the underused classic paradigm of âRezeptionsÃ¤sthetikâ with new research possibilities that follow ârealâ readers' traces online and offline. The author proposes Jenkins' concept of âparticipatory cultureâ as a tool that can potentially enrich scholarship on contemporary readers of Russian-language literature. As examples of such research perspectives, the author outlines three problems discussed within the framework of research on participatory cultures: new affective schemes of reading and writing, i.e. the ânew emotionalityâ of popular literatures; the well-known problem of âtreating characters as if they were real peopleâ in popular reading; and the impact of participatory cultures on the transcultural flows of texts, ideas, and translations.},

 abstract = {This essay argues that music and sound are as significant in Aigi's poetic world as are visual forms and images, with important implications for the poet's distinctive theology. His poetry responds to and itself resounds as music. The essay describes his strong personal connections to musicians and composers, and argues that his distinctive rhythms come from musical forms, not traditional poetic meters. For Aigi, meter is constraining but rhythm is expressive and inspiring. The essay treats a small number of poems, concentrating on âMotsart: âKassatsiia Iâ´ (âMozart: âCassation Iâ´ (1977), with its unusual rhetorical features and crucial use of repetition. The poem strives to create something like a musical chord and to layer its words in a way that reaches for unearthly, divine revelations. In showing the poem's theological implications, particularly its negative theology, and its use of musical forms, the essay draws on theoretical writings by Albright, Adorno, and Derrida.},

 abstract = {This essay argues that the categories of lyric utterance, subjectivity, and political insight have been rethought and reinvented by contemporary Russian poets, focusing on the exemplary work of Kirill Medvedev and Elena Fanailova. Their poems show how the category of the everyday is a scene where political meanings can be discerned: poems can be built out of rather ordinary encounters and experiences. Fanailova and Medvedev seek to make visible previously unnoticed aspects of experience, and to engage in forms of political speech based on personal interactions, economic transactions, and sexual encounters. The essay draws on theoretical work that ties poetic subjectivity to an emerging idea of freedom (Jacques RanciÃ¨re), or that links personal evolution to ethics (Stanley Cavell).},

In his experimental futuristic works, simultaneously verbal and visual, the author focused on setting up a stereoscopic space and constructing a graphic illusion within it. Three-dimensional perception and stereovision arise as a consequence of visualizing a particular image on a book page, as constructed by the poet. These visual images made of letters are intended to refer the reader to the liberating experience of space, as well as to the top of the pyramid of vision â hence the absence of a vanishing point, of a horizon and of a ground line. The image thus represents a plurality of viewpoints. The poet imagines the visible world as the world of optics, with an important role assigned to the mirror motif. The stylistics of a mirrored palindrome provides additional visual capability to the zaum'. The visual look of zaum' words was meant to help make its nature more relevant.},

As a result all traditional motifs, characters and roles are adapted to modern times, morals and values are inverted. The Biblical story of Babylon undergoes a similar treatment.},

 abstract = {In 1966 and again in 1969 Chukovskii published volumes titled Moi Uitmen. An examination of the two editions reveals significant differences in the selection, the ordering, and even the texts of the poetry. These differences turn out to be only the final stage in creating many different âWhitmansâ, beginning with Chukovskii's first volume dedicated to the American poet, PoÄt anarkhist Uot Uitman, published in 1907, and continuing through many redactions over the next six decades. Early in these endeavors Chukovskii sharply attacked Konstantin Bal'mont, his one great rival in first bringing Whitman to the attention of Russian readers. Bal'mont, however, turns out to have been a more skilled translator than many have asserted, and for that matter his poetry reveals as strong a likely influence of Whitman as do the leading Futurists, whom Chukovskii and others felt were Whitman's chief disciples in Russia. In the final analysis, Chukovskii's varied Whitmans are perhaps most valuable for providing an open laboratory of the translator at work, wrestling with the difficulties of conveying a new and in its day alien verse form in a different language.},

However, this article, surveying his now undeservedly ignored career, reveals another side to his writing: Lifshits not only composed unpublished verse highly critical of the authorities but also used various techniques â initially and most importantly, the mask of literary parody â to publish works expressing his aversion to much of what he observed in Soviet society. These writings show he was a principled, if often overlooked, opponent of the existing order.},

@article{SCHMID200767,
 abstract = {In his autobiography, Alexander Herzen tried to come to terms with the problematic relationship between history and private life. Herzen's views changed considerably while he was writing Byloe i dumy (My Past and Thoughts). In his essay, Ulrich Schmid argues that four different modes can be discerned in his conception of the history-private life relationship. This essay shows that each conception is related to a private catastrophe which Herzen interprets against a specific philosophical background. Herzen starts with a Hegelian conception: the illegitimate son of a Russian aristocrat, he encodes Russian society as a family tyrannized by a patriarchal Czar. After the failed revolutions of 1848 and the Herwegh affair, Herzen modifies his views: history is not propelled by rationalism, but by human action. In this second conception Herzen relies on the Polish thinker August von Cieszkowski. Later Herzen turns to Proudhon and his ironical affirmation of opposites: he covers up his own affair with Natalie Tuchkova-Ogareva by keeping the Herwegh affair in a half-public, half-secret status. Finally, in the 1860s Herzen witnesses the decay of his own family and interprets his alienation from his children in a Darwinian key.},

 abstract = {Dubravka UgreÅ¡iÄâs novel Baba Yaga Laid an Egg (Baba Jaga je snijela jaje, 2008; English translation 2010) represents an intertextually charged contribution to the world literary genre of the spa novel and its Slavic ramifications. The spa town is a traditional motif in world literature, standing at the crossroads of health and illness, love and death, treatment and entertainment, individual body and social norm. The spa novel in this instance features as âa novel-within-a-novelâ portraying a transnational community of Croatian wellness tourists, Bosnian war refugees, American businessmen and Russian mafiosi. The novel charts their encounters in a Central European spa town in the late 1990s. By using a multiplicity of intertextual references to literary works from Russian (Dostoevsky) and Czech literature (Kundera), UgreÅ¡iÄ inspects the health resort under post-communist conditions, as a site of intercultural communication and geopolitical dynamics. The article proposes an attendant reading of the novel as an account of broader social changes from disciplinary (Foucault) to control society (Deleuze). It argues further that UgreÅ¡iÄâs novel may also be read as a female critique of the pan-Slavic spa novel, which has hitherto been constructed in primarily male masterpieces from Dostoevsky to Chekhov or Kundera.},

It argues that along with such commonly discussed attributes as ineffectiveness, alienation, and heightened self-reflexivity, the superfluous men in Turgenev's Diary of a Superfluous Man, Dostoevskii's Notes from the Underground, and Bitov's Pushkin House suffer from a (proto)-postmodern malaise whose manifestation is the dissolution of the autonomous, essential self that exists independently of language. Furthermore, the paper suggests that somewhat paradoxically, the awareness of this malaise and the anguish associated with it become not more but less intense with the advent of the postmodern era. Of the three characters I consider, Leva Odoevtsev, the protagonist of Bitov's postmodern novel, seems to be the least aware of his condition and the least paralyzed by it.},

 abstract = {In the early 1930s, in the course of the First Five-Year Plan, the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers and the proclamation of Socialist Realism as the new literary doctrine, Maksim Gorâkii and Samuil Marshak tried to establish a new genre of popular science writing, âscientific-fictional literatureâ (ânauchno-khudozhestvennaia literaturaâ). This article reconstructs the emergence of this genre in the context of Soviet post-revolutionary euphoria for the scientific transformation of society and the avant-gardist experimental laboratories of dreams. The writer M.Â Ilâin, nowadays mostly forgotten, was the most widely published author and main advocate of this new kind of science writing at the time. In the 1930s, M.Â Ilâin adopted many of the devices and claims of prominent avant-garde artists such as Sergei Tretâiakov and appropriated them for his totalizing and globalizing approach to representation. In unpacking M. Ilâinâs prose, this article explores the complex and ambiguous formation of Socialist Realism in the field of popular scientific literature.},

@article{SELA202115,
 abstract = {This article studies the emergence of the âself-taught poetâ position in Russian literature of the 1820s and its dependence on the system of literary patronage. Literati had notable control over the careers of poets from unprivileged social classes and shaped their choices of literary form to fit these peasant poets to particular aesthetic expectations. It is shown how literary patrons (Pavel Svinâin and Boris Fedorov) tried to implement the successful English model of Robert Bloomfield and keep their protÃ©gÃ©s within the confines of pastoral poetry and the setting of rural labour. The case of the serf Fedor Slepushkin â the most prominent self-taught poet of 1820s â demonstrates a clear connection to the English pastoral tradition and the role of the Romantic ârural idyllâ in his success among political elites. The article also shows that the aesthetic window for the pastoral model of the peasant poet was not open for long. The organic aesthetics that spread in the 1830s established folkloric foundations for national literature, and âpeasant songâ replaced âpeasant pastoralâ. This shift underlay the success of Aleksei Koltsov in the 1830â1840s, who was the first Russian poet to both occupy the position of self-taught poet and use folksong language in his poetry.},

 abstract = {The paper examines the history of the Soviet/Russian humorous TV show KVN (Klub veselykh i nakhodchivykh) from the 1960s to the present day, as a spectacular example of the duality of the Soviet cultural sphere. KVN began in 1961 as a game show featuring university teams. It quickly became a separate genre of samodeiatelânostâ and a part of non-official culture, a place for artistic experiments, satire, and even civic engagement. Closed in 1972 after experiencing growing pressure, the show was reborn under Perestroika in 1986, becoming a hotbed of social and political satire. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, KVN grew into a movement consisting of several leagues and thousands of teams in different countries, not counting unofficial groups and competitions. Its former participants now dominate entertainment television in Russia, and the KVN show remains among the most popular entertainment programs on Channel One. At the same time, in recent years KVN has become an exemplary case of âofficially approvedâ satire and humor and a semi-official state project that is now being used as a platform for the promotion of the âright political courseâ.},

Special attention will be paid to the genre in which Zhvanetskii has established himself, and his method will be examined in the light of the concepts of carnival, myth, and auto-communication.

 abstract = {In âNotes on Prosodyâ (1964), Vladimir Nabokov's most detailed delineation of his views on versification, special attention is given to âpausative verseâ. The present discussion of the semantic aura this meter had for Nabokov delves into the origins of his notion of the phenomenon, showing Nabokov's indebtedness to Sergei Bobrov's experimental writings on verse theory, especially to Bobrov's substantiation of the term âpauznikâ in his numerous pre-Revolutionary publications on poetics. The outwardly paradoxical nature of Nabokov's attitude toward âpausative verseâ was characterized, on the one hand, by his appreciation of this medium, and his avoidance of it in his own poetic praxis, on the other. It also can be called a focal point where various aspects of Nabokov's appreciation for Aleksandr Blok, the meter's most influential practitioner, come together. Making use of published as well as unpublished documents that shed light on Nabokov's notion of Blok's most lasting achievement, the present article shows that Nabokov's relationship with Blok cannot be satisfactorily interpreted along the lines of Harold Bloom's âanxiety of influenceâ, while an examination of Nabokov's translated oeuvre demonstrates that our present idea of his apparent aversion to accentual verse is in need of reconsideration.},

 abstract = {NabokovÊ¼s admission in a 1971 interview that at some point in 1918, before leaving Russia, he translated certain lieder by Heinrich Heine (1797â1856) has been cited in a number of contexts. Almost invariably, however, this is done with the all-too-predictable aim of casting into doubt NabokovÊ¼s self-professed lack of knowledge of German on the one hand, and to serve as a springboard for highly speculative suppositions concerning the writerÊ¼s alleged indebtedness to this or that putative German source, on the other. Surprisingly, prior to the commencement of the research effort that lent impetus to the present study, no attempt has been made to delve into the facts and consequences of NabokovÊ¼s creative engagement with the giant of the German cultural tradition whose distinct kind of lyricism and poetic diction exerted a singularly powerful, indeed formative, influence on Russian letters. Below I introduce and interpret concrete textual data pertaining to NabokovÊ¼s dialogue with the German-Jewish poet that first took place in the medium of translation, continued in NabokovÊ¼s original work written in his imitation, and eventually left an indelible mark on some of the writerÊ¼s most consequential creations. NabokovÊ¼s contribution to Russian Heineana, his life-long appreciation of Heine, shed new and unexpected light on the writerÊ¼s relationship with his artistic paragons, while representing a fascinating manifestation of Nabokovian intertextuality.},

 abstract = {Like many persons of their circle, the Medtners were well acquainted with the new trends in modern dance, and especially with Isadora Duncan's dance, Emile Jaques-Dalcroze's rhythmic gymnastic and Rudolf Steiner's Eurhythmie. While Nikolai favoured Duncan dance, Emil preferred Dalcroze and paid several visits to the Swiss maÃ®tre at his schools in Hellerau and Geneva. The brothers' interest in dance might be stimulated by the contemporary theoretical discussion of the âmotorâ nature of music as well as the practical question: to what extent choreography should follow the music. The article also examines dances and a ballet staged to works by Nikolai Medtner.},

 abstract = {The divine forces in Gombrowicz's world do not relate to Virtue, but to cruelty and devilishness. These forces must be grasped within the specific structure of his universe. A key concept is the category of âformâ. Further, there is his concept of âthe interhuman churchâ, which implies human interaction with the Other through Form. The Other makes the subject suffer, or even provokes its death. At first sight it might seem that the divine can be conjured up by a youthful body, charming the spectator, spreading the magic of its beauty. However, the body of flesh and blood that triumphs over the power of the Spirit, is devilish by its very nature. Only the existence without Form seems to create a space for liberty. Thanks to the disruption of devilish interaction with the Other, the individual is overwhelmed by a sentiment of victorious joy. But almost immediately he tastes the bitterness of this infinitesimal moment of emptiness. In his nakedness man faces his own obscure, dishonourable devilishness. Since every concept and element considered sacred in the fictional universe of Gombrowicz is in the end bound by Evil, the real space of transcendence (if there is one), must be found outside the human world.},

 abstract = {The present collection of papers is the first attempt to juxtapose the late Soviet and Putin eras in Russian nonconformist culture. The contributors examine shifts as well as zones of transition along the axis between conformity and nonconformity from the 1960s to the present. This focus on the exchange between the unofficial and official responds to the growing claim in recent scholarship, that it is necessary to approach late socialism and its countercultures as larger interacting discursive fields, and thus to complicate the previously assumed dichotomies. Moreover, the investigation of the hybridity of late socialism in the first part of the issue allows us to explore and understand the nuanced and even contradictory nature of (non)conformity after 2000 in the second part.},

 abstract = {In this paper I examine the interdependence of the late Soviet unofficial culture and the artistâs everyday communicative context, the underground scene, in which the individual and the social environment coalesce. The syntagmatically organized lifeworld of the Soviet underground was in contrast with the paradigm of state institutions that were structured in analogy with the party apparatus. Two axes of collective communication emerged, comparable to two different tropes: analogy and spatial proximity. Along this horizontal axis, the poetics and aesthetics of the unofficial literature and art can be traced back to the communicative and therefore systemic environment of the artists and authors. Much more than finished artifacts, their products were the result of an interactive process of creation within a very specific sociocultural domain, where shared sources, codes and aesthetics were combined with the possibility of direct influence. Many unofficial artifacts were born from the lively communication between writers and visual artists. In this context I discuss metonymy, intermediality and the phenomena of auto-reflexivity and metatextuality. My approach is situated between Boris Eikhenbaumâs sociology of literature, Iurii Tynianovâs cultural semiotics avant la letter, and JÃ¼rgen Habermasâ theory of communicative action.},

The analysis focuses on the interplay between scientific and religious discourses in the text as represented, broadly, by the story's two protagonists. This dichotomy, however, becomes complicated in an episode where Gurov pronounces authoritative scientific statements about the universe which nonetheless allude to a religious intertext, specifically the Book of Job. The article traces Gurov's gradual abandonment of his divine, omniscient position and explores the ethical implications of this transformation and, more broadly, the ethical aspect of Chekhovian epistemology.},

@article{SOKOLOVA2016147,
 abstract = {Paradox as a method of contrasting alternative ideas is one of the crucial principles of the avant-garde. The article proposes to call such a way of organization of artistic reality, which is somewhat similar to Gilles Deleuze's âdisjunctive synthesisâ, the âirremovable contradictionâ principle. The paper analyses the systems of art of two neo-avant-garde poets: Gennadii Aigi and Viktor Sosnora. Their works stand for the two poles of contemporary avant-garde. The various antinomic structural and grammatical categories are present in their art, ranging from bigger bodies of texts (books, strophoids, ultra-long lines) to the smaller language units (discursive interjections, sounds, punctuation marks). The paper argues that the poets' simultaneous immersion into the wholeness of a book and the fragmentarity of a draft raises the issue of âprocessualâ localization of the subject. The subject bridges the gap between word and reality, as well as between body and text. The article sets out the different principles and traditions of creating ultra-long lines in the works of both Aigi and Sosnora. Sosnora was interested in the ancient aesthetics and metrics, whereas Aigi's inclination was towards prosaization. Experiments with ultra-short lines as another pole of non-standard line format constitute a distinctive feature of Aigi's poetics. Sosnora seldom used single lines and preferred to combine them according to the principle of contrast with large text fragments within the borders of poetic cycles. Finally, the article shows the development of this tendency to minimalization, which is expressed in the division of words into verbal atoms. It is common for Sosnora to use minimal discursive words that undergo optional reduction and âindexical and symbolical interjectionâ, whereas Aigi aims at maximum atomization of the word that revitalizes the primal sound and the process of its creation.},

Gerasim, the hero of the novella, is both deaf and mute, thus rendering it impossible to infer his thoughts and feelings via external observation alone. The culmination of Turgenev's efforts to overcome this self-imposed obstruction is the discovery of a new and qualitatively different narrative position â that of the author of the novel who holds the authority to render transparent the hearts and minds of his characters. This position is soon to be consolidated and explored in the ensuing Russian realist novel.},

 abstract = {The bulk of Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD) was written in 1926, while the genesis of the idea dates back to 1925. That summer, Belyi moved from Moscow to Kuchino, where he was able to live quietly and had the opportunity to think, walk and work. In October, he delivered a course of lectures on the history of self-consciousness to the actors of the theatre MKhAT-2. This course of lectures became the impulse for writing ISSD. Belyi wrote the 600-page book very quickly: between January and May of 1926 he drafted the text, while from May to July he read through his work, adding some examples and correcting the text. Until the end of his life, Belyi maintained that ISSD was unfinished. However, it is possible that he did not want to write the last chapter of ISSD âDukhovnaia naukaâ since âDukhovnaia naukaâ for Belyi was not an ordinary chapter title, but his motto for the future.},

Throughout his life the writer was afraid of the Evil Eye and his fear became especially acute when he lived in Dornach, when he was deeply involved in occult practice and had a serious personal and mental crisis. From his letters, diaries and memoirs we understand that he regarded any creative crisis, difficulty with friends or personal problem as the result of the Evil Eye. It is shown in the article that Belyi thought that the Evil Eye was a powerful weapon of black magicians fighting to rule the world. The Evil Eye motive is incorporated into Belyiâs notion of the world being the battlefield of occult powers of Evil and powers of Good. From this point of view he regarded the fate of the individual (first and foremost, himself), the fate of Russia and of all humankind.},

 abstract = {The paper considers a fictive-religious actant of General Samsonov, one of the main characters in August 1914, Knot I of Aleksandr Solzhenitsynâs epic The Red Wheel. It examines the convergence between the cultural consciousness of the general, as manifested in the last days of his life, and that of his peasant troops. Formative to both, as this analysis demonstrates, are patterns of profoundly archaic thought which were typical at the time for the majority of the Russian population, with fateful consequences for the nationâs fate. Special attention is paid to the concluding scene in the Samsonov chapters, where the general takes his own life. This episode is interpreted as a depiction of an ethically exalted âjustified suicideâ, a rare but religiously licit act within the Orthodox tradition. The paper also explores the conceptual tensions underpinning Solzhenitsynâs employment of archaic and innovative forms in the epic, and the roots of this intellectual conflict in his consciousness.},

@article{STATKIEWICZ20181,
 abstract = {Did the events of 9/11, 2001 reveal the danger of nihilism? AndrÃ© Glucksmannâs book DostoÃ¯evski Ã  Manhattan (2002) elicited a discussion concerned with the diagnosis of nihilism and with the value of literary engagement with it. Are Dostoevskiiâs novels âjust literatureâ, lacking a rigorous philosophic analysis of nihilism? In my analysis of Nietzscheâs Notes and Dostoevskiiâs Demons, I attempt to show that the framework of the âold quarrelâ between philosophy and literature, in which this discussion has been situated, proves untenable in the face of nihilism. The recognition of the latterâs ambiguity would be eventually not so much a matter of rigorous argumentation as of what Dostoevskiiâs heroes call âfeeling of thoughtâ (âchuvstvo mysliâ), and what Nietzsche specifies in respect to nihilism as âfeeling of valuelessnessâ (âdas GefÃ¼hl der Wertlosigkeitâ), which literature can best convey. However, this task of literature needs to be prepared by âa thought in which abstract powers have been humiliatedâ (Camus). Nietzsche points out the roots of nihilism in the excessive trust in âthe categories of reasonâ (âdie Vernunft-Kategorienâ), and in their eventual collapse; Dostoevskii makes feel the danger of their âterrible abstractednessâ (âstrashnaia otvlechennostââ) in the flesh.},

 abstract = {As critics have noted, Herzen's Byloe i dumy (My Past and Thoughts) can be approached as a Bildungsroman describing the emergence of a self-conscious autonomous personality. But while the theme of spiritual growth and maturation is prominent in Herzen's autobiography, both the author's radical break with Hegel's rationalism, accomplished in the early 1850s, and the tragic mood of Part Five call into question the view that Herzen's autobiography is a Bildungsroman. In her essay, Lina Steiner argues that certain aspects of Hegel's thought â especially, his dialectical approach to individual emergence â remained crucial to Herzen's ideology. This essay tries to show that the maturation of Herzen's autobiographical hero follows a dialectical pattern, which is close to Hegel's description of love in his early essay âDie Liebeâ. The relationship between Herzen and his wife Natalie tells a story of their mutual Bildung through love. However, this pivotal narrative, which unfolds throughout Parts Four and Five and transforms My Past and Thoughts into a double Bildungsroman, ends in a tragedy. Thus, instead of reading Herzen's autobiography purely as a Bildungsroman, we can treat it as an example of generic fusion: a tragic Bildungsroman.},

In the 1920s, the researching writer represents a hidden, but influential counterpart to the widely propagated figure of the working writer. While the author as producer combines word and deed in an operative act, the author as researcher investigates the production of knowledge. This entails revising the centrality of facts. Literature as artistic research subverts factography by going beyond the horizons of veristic data registration to include uncharted realms and vague possibilities. This exploration leads to specific genres: the author as researcher tries his hand at a kind of laboratory text, a prolific genre at the intersection of testing equipment, recording media, and hypothetical thought. Not confined to a sterile lab, avant-garde writer-researchers, as members of research expeditions, oscillate between their home writing desks and the remote depths of the emerging USSR. At the same time, they explore writing practices situated between data acquisition, sampling, fact-finding, observation and recording.},

The film enables the audience to visualise CvetaevaÊ¼s life in France and her self-representation as a Russian Ã©migrÃ© author.},

 abstract = {The article assesses the contribution of LÃ©on Robel, Aigi's friend and biographer, to the study of the poet's works. Special attention is paid to the influence of Aigi on the poetry of Robel himself, particularly on his âAigiistâ poems-dedications. Comparative text analysis reveals some similarities between the two authors. Robel âmirrorsâ the main constructive principle formulated by Aigi in his poetry. The specific use of punctuation marks and spaces allows the poet to create verbal conglomerates which, like combinations of hieroglyphs, denote a new subject or a new sensory experience. The poet conceives verbal masses as the world thrown into textual space, now expanding, then contracting. Intertextual analysis reveals a significant thematic dialogue between the two poets.},

 abstract = {In the 1920s the problem of how to deal with the poetry of the tsarist past became even more acute when the poem in question was also a fairy tale. Fairy tales were an embattled genre in the first decades of Soviet power, vilified under Lenin for their religious, royal and magical content, but revived under Stalin in the service of heroic nationalism. The status of Pushkin, the father of the canon of Russian fairy tale classics, was likewise contested, as his works were purged from public schools and libraries by Leninâs wife Nadezhda Krupskaia in the 1920s, then glorified in enormous Stalin-era jubilee celebrations of 1937 and 1949. This article looks at the problem of Pushkinâs verse fairy tale âSkazka o pope i o rabotnike ego Baldeâ (âThe Tale of the Priest and His Worker Baldaâ, 1830) and how illustrated versions of the work helped to negotiate dramatic changes in political culture in the years 1917â1953.},

Having examined various scholarly opinions on the causes of Akhmatova's puzzling repudiation of Chekhov's works and personality despite a striking proximity in their artistic sensibilities, the discussion, developing the leads left by previous researchers, moves beyond the existing explanations in order to uncover hidden psychological roots of this mysterious animosity.},

BelyiÊ¼s notion, on the one hand, develops Rudolf SteinerÊ¼s doctrine of the Consciousness Soul, rooted in Aristotelian philosophy. On the other hand, Belyi finds a new way to define the relationship of soul and spirit by using his Symbolist method of âMono-Duo-Pluralismâ. This combines the anthroposophical doctrine of soul with theory of knowledge, developed on the basis of Goethe by the young Steiner in his philosophical work.},

This paper examines Solzhenitsynâs philosophy of history and predilection for historical counterfactuality as expressed in his âepopeeâ, as well as its anthologizing treatment of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature. The experimental aspects of the saga, for example the quasi-cinematic Screens, use of montage, variable modes of narration, and diegetic blanks and ellipses, are discussed with reference to the practices of Russian and Western modernism.},

@article{THORSTENSSON202061,
 abstract = {This article discusses Aleksei Suvorinâs revisions of his 1865 series of feuilletons âVsiakieâ (âAll Sortsâ). Originally published in Sankt-Peterburgskie vedomosti (Saint-Petersburg News) as the beginning of a roman-feuilleton, they were reworked into a polemical novel of the same name, which was censored and burnt in the wake of Karakozovâs attempted assassination of Alexander II on 4 April 1866. The author analyzes Suvorinâs edits and revisions through the prism of their critical readings by the Censorship Department and the Ministry of the Interior. Examining the politically âuntrustworthyâ aspects of Vsiakie, the censor raised questions about the connections between the genres of the feuilleton, roman-feuilleton and the polemical novel. In particular, the censorâs reading touched upon the problem of the authorial position, the reduced distance between fiction and life, and the existence of numerous structural and thematic links between various polemical novels of that period. In the case of Vsiakie, therefore, the censor acted as a peculiar institution of literary criticism. Its critical readings can be not only relevant to the analysis of Vsiakie, but also instrumental for an understanding of the poetics and ideology of the polemical novel of the 1860s.},

@article{TIHANOV2008259,
 abstract = {To a significant degree, this study is meant as a contribution to clearing the ground for a proper scholarly biography of Gustav Shpet (1879â1937) which someone might undertake to write in the future (for a first helpful attempt, see Å Äedrina 2004). To that end, I draw on previously unheeded published and unpublished sources, bringing together strains of research that have so far remained unconnected. My prime concern will be to establish the most significant aspects of Shpet's involvement with Russian and Soviet culture (including literature, translation, and the theatre). The examination I undertake is intent on revealing his scattered talents and energy, and â in the years after 1927 â his tragically multifarious life under the political duress of Stalinism. I begin by analysing Shpet's intellectual and political predicament at GAKhN in the late 1920s, an episode of crucial significance for his marginalisation and brutal victimisation during the 1930s. As I will demonstrate, the roots of Shpet's instability lay back in the early 1920s, yet it was not until the Stalinisation of culture and scholarship gathered momentum in the second half of the 1920s that his position of leadership and public visibility grew untenable. After focusing on the propaganda campaign against GAKhN and the consequences it had for Shpet, I work back chronologically to review Shpet's immersion in Russian Symbolism and his contacts with the Imagists. In the final two sections I offer an analysis of Shpet's career as a translator and of his theatre affiliations, both falling largely in the 1930s and shaped in no small measure by the ideological constraints of Stalinism.},

 abstract = {The presence of semantic paleontology in Soviet literary and cultural theory and its wider relevance for the ideological debates of the 1930s have never before been examined systematically. I attempt such an examination in the present article. At the outset, I outline the foundations of semantic paleontology and its interventions in the study of literature during the 1930s; as a next step, the analysis focuses on the principal methodological distinctions which semantic paleontology sought to draw in order to assert its own identity vis-Ã -vis other trends. Subsequent sections explore the significance of semantic paleontology for the 1930s polemics on the boundaries of modernity and weigh its impact on cultural and literary theory. As will become evident, this impact did not follow the channels of official recognition, yet it persisted into the early 1980s, at times paradoxically reinforced by the criticism which semantic paleontology attracted.},

 abstract = {In NabokovÊ¼s texts among polygenetic motifs hidden mythological allusions play an important role. The less poetic attribute of Demeter, the image of the pig, is an ambivalent and archetypical complex code of fertility and dirt, divine and devilish. The pig-motif in Greek mythology is closely attached also to Circe, whose story (Odyssey, Song 10) has a system of references in NabokovÊ¼s Lolita, in âThe Enchanted Huntersâ chapter. These parallels raise the question of a further intertextual cluster, JoyceÊ¼s Ulysses (Ch. 15), as biographical data prove that Lolita was commenced the same months when Nabokov launched his lectures on Joyce at Cornell. This coincidence gives a firm base to investigate the common poetic strategies in Lolita and Ulysses, among them â the textual metamorphoses and the development and function of the pig, dog and nymph images.},

 abstract = {Libertinism has to be understood as it was from the beginning, liberty of thinking in philosophy and liberty of body in erotics at the same time. The opposition of the socially accepted behaviour and the individual cultivation of pleasure was a choice from the times of antiquity. Libertinism positioned itself for Ã©patage in order to be different from the masses (stay outside) and for forming an elite over the masses (outstand). Nabokov's case is relevant from the point of view of libertinism and dandyism â both in his art and his life. His Anglophile family with his father a liberal aristocrat gave him a solid background to outstand in both senses. In his oeuvre, French and British intertextual patterns played an important role for the constant presence of the libertine and dandy concept. Ada's utopic topography and out-of-society paradise-staging represent an ideal topos for free thought and love. Nabokov's poetics of uninhibited libido stands for his concept of freedom of Self and body, for the abolishing of moral conventions of âposhlostâ´, for the âvirtue or the vanity of virtueâ. This finally results in the elimination of reality, a quest for the supreme realm, very similar to Viacheslav Ivanov's a realibus ad realiora.},

In his youth, Poplavskii was much influenced by anthroposophist and theosophist doctrines, and later manifested a deep interest in occult and magical writings. In this article, I analyze the magic in Poplavskiiâs work from a number of perspectives, including those of concrete rituals and techniques (witchcraft, invocation, alchemy, meditation), as well as practical mysticism (Christian and Jewish) and different patterns of âdivine-workingâ (theurgy) which have had an explicit or implicit impact on Poplavskiiâs poetic and narrative texts. In particular, I highlight the visual component of various magical practices referenced by Poplavskii.},

 abstract = {The article is devoted to the first major publication of Russian charms prepared by Ivan Petrovich Sakharov (1807â1863) and published in the book Skazaniia russkogo naroda o semeinoi zhizni svoikh predkov (The Tales of the Russian People about the Family Life of Their Ancestors; 1841). The article contains the analysis of 11 military charms, which are compared with authentic military charms from manuscript collections of the XVIIâXIX centuries. The author comes to the conclusion that military charms published by Sakharov can be divided into three groups. At one pole there are two texts that almost completely correspond to authentic military charms and were probably borrowed by Sakharov from some manuscript collection of charms from enemy weapons. At the other pole we mention four texts that have almost nothing in common with original charms and were most likely com-posed by Sakharov himself. Between those poles there are five texts of mixed character: authentic and edited (inserted) fragments are combined in them in approximately equal parts. The desire to create his own version of oral tradition, to prove the antiquity and aesthetic dignity of folk art, patriotic pathos, the ambition to circumvent censorship, specific literary talent, counting on commercial success â these are, apparently, the factors that inspired Sakharov to falsify.},

@article{TRUBIKHINA2009131,
 abstract = {This essay deals with arguably the most original of contemporary Russian women poets, Elena Shvarts. Shvarts was born in 1948 in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad). Because of the religious connotations of her poetry and a style that shocked Soviet censors, Shvarts's poetry could not be published in Russia officially until 1989. Shvarts's poetry had been widely known before her first official publication in the Soviet Union; it had been published both abroad and in the âSamizdatâ, bringing her early fame and a reputation as one of the most unusual writers of her generation. Since the late 1980s, Shvarts experienced a real surge of creativity; she traveled widely, participated in many literary readings and festivals in Europe and the US, and was the recipient of many literary awards. The focus of this essay is the specific ways in which Shvarts, in her poetry and prose writings, ties together Russian history, ecumenical mysticism, sectarianism, and pagan myth with autobiographical narrative. These characteristics of Shvarts's poetics are considered through the lens of the essay âPoets With History and Poets Without Historyâ by her major poetic predecessor, Marina Tsvetaeva.},

 abstract = {The present paper analyses short prose texts written in the 1830sâ1840s under the generic label âlegendâ either in their titles or subtitles. The aim of the research is to ascertain whether such texts followed a similar generic pattern. The article shows that the chosen texts share a network of constituent properties, which indicates their generic cognateness and allows the reader to classify them as literary legends. The Russian literary legend of the 1830sâ1840s may be characterized as a historical narrative relating extraordinary, sometimes criminal events. Though the audience is likely to disbelieve the story, the narrator finds it necessary to communicate it, as it contains an important truth or idea missing from conventional sources. Despite the similarity of the generic pattern, the genre had fuzzy boundaries in the first half of the nineteenth century, which is revealed in numerous title alterations, inconsistency in using cognate labels (âskazanieâ, âpredanieâ, âbylââ), the absence of legend cycles, and a paucity of discussions about the genre. However, it can be concluded that the literary legend of the time was the grain from which the late-nineteenth century genre developed.},

The author demonstrates the tension between the literal and metaphorical significance of the poem's imagery, in particular with respect to bodily and physical motifs. Special attention is given to the multifaceted roles of the addressee(s) within and without the poem, the blurring of which is characteristic of avant-garde poetics.},

In his Istoriia stanovleniia samosoznaiushchei dushi (ISSD) (1926) Belyi perceives affects in the life of the body as experience of the immediate sensations of some âself-conscious Iâ. According to Belyi, affects are not the obstacles for such consciousness, but on the contrary, are the privileged channel of connecting the individual with universal existence, which Belyi, using the anthroposophical vocabulary, calls the âastralâ. In other words, the âself-conscious Iâ meets the âastral body of the worldâ at the point of affects. As a result of such a meeting point, the body and sensuality of a human being should individualize, and consciousness should acquire its own passion.},

These texts reflected an anthropological experience and response to oppression and violence in human society.

Avant-gardists expressed experiences of alienated labor, interpreted as experiences of violence, through hyperbolic imagery. The author proposes to study the avant-garde in the context of the extreme experience of violence, in which the political and the poetic are sometimes entwined.},

 abstract = {The subject as modelled in contemporary literature has to be capable of making choices, but without suppressing the other. In other words it must both have free will and not have it. In Russian poetry we can find such models in the texts of Dmitrii Prigov and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko. Prigov offers two levels of the subject. The first represents a subject-mask as an incarnation of any language practice: on this level, the will as a stereotype is deconstructed. The subject of the second level slides between subjects of the first; but this movement is evidence of free will. In contrast, Dragomoshchenkoâs subject is fluid: he has no fixed boundaries, erases himself, and limits his own will in order to clear a space for the will of other subjects that interest him. In this manner, Dragomoshchenkoâs subject accesses a stream of events from which he draws material for self-construction. Prigovâs subject is social, whereas Dragomoshchenkoâs subject is asocial; however, they have a similar foundation in will. An approach to the problem of will for both lies in changes that lead the subject to new and interesting forms not yet ossified in any definite structure.},

This state of mind determined the pragmatic meaning of the poems that Khodasevich wrote in the period between 1922 and 1925, i.e. the time in which he emigrated to Europe and yet did not feel himself a ârealâ emigrant. These poems are characterized by a satirical orientation as well as by a radical rejection of emigration. On the other hand, the texts that were written between 1925 and 1927 (when Khodasevich formed his self-identification as an emigrant) radically changed the pragmatics of European Night: In this way it becomes a book expressing a deep existential despair. This inner crisis includes the Russian space as well as the space of emigration. In our study we also analyse the way in which Khodasevich mitigates the satirical orientation of the first version of the book.},

 abstract = {The present article seeks, in general, to reassess the literary output of Polish Modernism by introducing and applying some concepts and ideas from the field of visual studies. One of the main ideas underlying the emerging domain of visual studies is the notion of a âpictorialâ or âvisual turnâ, i.e. a shift from a literary toward a visual paradigm in cultural relations and hierarchies. Visual studies is, however, not only concerned with the growing deployment of visualization at every level of contemporary culture and society, but also focuses on what might be called the ârhetoricâ of visual experience and representation throughout the history of Western culture.},

 abstract = {Gombrowicz attempts in his oeuvre to give voice to a paradoxical, self-undermining concept of authenticity. âInauthenticâ authenticity is best realized by the personal and fragmentary form of his Diary. Gombrowicz turns out to be an heir of Romanticism, especially of the philosophy of the self-development of âGeistâ (Hegel), which, however, in his case, does not culminate in âfulfilmentâ. The author's ambivalent attitude towards Romantic authenticity determines his critical attitude to Polish Romanticism, which in his times had become an ossified part of the Polish national tradition. According to Gombrowicz the thoughtless adoption of the Polish romantic paradigm of exile, suffering and alienation as the general fundament of Polishness made it unfit (in spite of its similarity to the predicament of twentieth-century man) to express existential anguish. So he had to find a new form of alienation without reminiscences of its romantic counterpart. This led to a reappraisal of the Polish literary tradition. Especially to Gombrowicz's liking was the âdegenerateâ style of the Sarmatic Baroque.},

 abstract = {This paper provides the first detailed description of the initial phases of the wider circulation of Dostoevskyâs works, in the context of the enlargement of the reading audience and of the development of the book publishing industry in Russia at the turn of 19â20th centuries. Special attention is paid to A.G. Dostoevskaiaâs editions of the Complete Works and to the adapted editions of Dostoevskiiâs works addressed to specific segments of the Russian public, such as children and peasants. Alongside with statistical data on the diffusion of Dostoevskiiâs works in the last two decades of the 19th century, the paper touches upon two aspects: on the one hand, publishers and pedagoguesâ efforts to adapt Dostoevskyâs texts to half-educated readers of lower-middle classes, and on the other, readersâ reactions to them. The paper includes a large number of quotations from memoirs and sociological reports that testify how the new publishing formats and mechanisms of distribution of Dostoevskiiâs works informed their circulation and reception.},

 abstract = {The article explores how the social changes of the Russian Great reforms are represented through the love triangle between peasants and nobles in Aleksei Pisemskiiâs folk drama Bitter Fate (1859). The adultery of peasant woman Lizaveta falling in love with her landowner becomes a more universal story about the crisis of patriarchal rituals under the onslaught of modernization. The author shows that in Pisemskiiâs drama many emancipatory ideas, embodied in the main character Ananii, are closely intertwined with archaic practices and concepts of sin, repentance, and love, which suggests that the modernization project failed. Moreover, the article shows that constant references to tyranny, executions, and tortures in the speech of Lizaveta and Ananii revive the spirit of the bloody Russian history of the eighteenth century, which occupies a large place in the literary and cultural mythology of the Great Reforms era.},

This article, however, zooms in on the symbolic role of Iaroslavna. A meticulous analysis of her magical lament clearly shows Igor's wife to be a character that also gives voice to the Russian Earth. The article further demonstrates the relationship that exists between the âPlachâ and the enigmatic end of the Slovo: Igor's visit to the Church of the Holy Mother on the Borichev. Given the knowledge that this site used to be the centre of the pagan cult of Rod and Zemlia, the author ventures to conclude that Iaroslavna and the Mother of God Pirogoshchaia constitute two aspects of the semi-pagan and semi-Christian cult of Mat' Syra Zemlia.},

@article{VIDUGIRIT2019123,
 abstract = {This article focuses on representations of space in Viktor Pelevinâs novel S.N.U.F.F.: a utÃ¸pia (2012). Pelevin structures the space of this novel by employing two classical forms of utopia â a city and an earthly paradise. The fictional dual capital Slava-Byzantium functions like an archaic city (the very first embodiment, according to Lewis Mumford, of utopia itself). In ancient urban settlements, the king had the power to provide people with food; and also to transform their bodies into machines for constructing majestic buildings and fighting his enemies. In the same way, the utopian world of Slava-Byzantium is characterized by huge terror and a rather ambiguous welfare system. Pelevin uses the utopia of a natural paradise to show the way to escape this dystopian city. The myth of escaping to nature is accompanied by the myth of a new superman, a hero who is disguised as an artificial woman. The surrogate woman Kaya echoes the Gaia of the hypothesis created by James Lovelock and highlights new prospects for life on Earth combined with technological advancement. In S.N.U.F.F., in short, Pelevin presents a neo-mythological interpretation of the geographical world around us.},

 abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of the novel Russian Beauty (Russkaia krasavitsa) by Viktor Erofeev. Written between 1980 and 1982 and published in 1989, the novel caused a stir among critics. The paper focuses on the mythological elements in Russian Beauty. Mythological elements are visible in the novelâs structure and in its narrator-protagonist Irina Tarakanova, who recounts her life and accomplishments as a promiscuous girl, a model and a lesbian. Her navigation of obstacles can be interpreted through the lens of Campbellâs monomyth (2009), as the journey of a hero who, thanks to a calling âfrom aboveâ, leaves everydayness and enters the world of adventures, eventually returning spiritually and physically renewed. Irina undergoes the same journey also based such a âcallingâ, but her story is subverted as the mythological is trivialised, and the spiritual downgraded to the corporeal. Irinaâs independent decisions, which are diametrically opposed to âhigher goalsâ, are interpreted through the concept of narcissism (Freud 1914; MatijaÅ¡eviÄ 2016), since the protagonist successfully realises (writes) her own myth â a monomyth.},

Those that deal exclusively with Peter III's accession are traditional in content and composition, as one might expect by virtue of the legitimate and orderly transition from Elizabeth to Peter. The panegyrics that welcomed the Catherinian coup, however, had to confront the fact that the new monarch was a usurper. This study explores the theories of legitimation to which panegyrists appealed in their attempts to justify her seizure of power.},

 abstract = {The brief reign of Peter III, followed by the coup d'Ã©tat that brought his wife, Catherine II, to power, is addressed in a large number of panegyrics published between 1762 and 1764. Those that deal exclusively with Peter III's accession are traditional in content and composition, as one might expect by virtue of the legitimate and orderly transition from Elizabeth to Peter. The panegyrics that welcomed the Catherinian coup, however, had to confront the fact that the new monarch was a usurper. This study explores the theories of legitimation to which panegyrists appealed in their attempts to justify her seizure of power.},

@article{VSTSTJN201931,
 abstract = {In nineteenth-century Romantic poetry, the lyric âIâ was usually identified with the poet himself. This changed at the beginning of the twentieth century, when poets (Pound and Eliot, for instance) introduced speakers (âpersonaeâ) into their poetry who were clearly different from themselves. Instead of âthe poetâ, new terms were introduced to refer to the speaker in the poem. In German lyric theory, the term âdas lyrische Ichâ (âthe lyric Iâ) became popular, as in Russian did âliricheskii geroiâ (âthe lyric heroâ). English and American critics generally use âthe speakerâ and âthe poetâ (often indiscriminately in the same book or article). As the speaker in the poem is, in principle, a fictive construct and cannot be identified with the poet, and as many poems do not have an âIâ, this paper argues for the use of the term âthe speakerâ.},

 abstract = {This paper contextualizes Khodasevich's poem âSlezy Rakhiliâ (âRachel's Tearsâ; 1916) and his article âVoina i poeziiaâ (âWar and Poetryâ; 1938) as his responses to World War I and to the Munich agreement, respectively. I contend that the First World War provided the impetus to Khodasevich for starting to write modernist poetry, in which he explicitly opposed âthenâ and ânowâ, a contrast that lies at the core of modernist consciousness. In Khodasevich's case, this acute awareness of a break with previous values had a personal quality, as the birth of his modernist poetics evolved out of a personal crisis in the wake of the suicide of his closest friend, Samuil Kissin, on 22 March 1916. Khodasevich's poem âSlezy Rakhiliâ recapitulates macro- and micro-histories, referring to the broader issue of refugees and deportees and to Kissin's tragic end. âSlezy Rakhiliâ is also a self-referential war poem as it reflects on current war poetry and questions whether poetry can adequately negotiate modernity in its most extreme form of a modern war. It is a conscious exploration of the contrast between âestablished thingsâ and the new catastrophic reality of war and postwar Russia and Europe that makes Khodasevich a modernist poet and unites him with other modernist poets, like Vladimir Maiakovskii, despite their personal and literary animosities.},

 abstract = {The lyric âIâ or lyric subject in a poem is often identified with the poet himself. However, what the lyric âIâ says is much more than a personal statement from the âempiricalâ poet, the poet as he exists in real life. In expressing his views, thoughts and feelings and telling about his adventures or daily affairs, the poet, if gifted, transcends the personal to the universal. Boris Ryzhii is a very âpersonalâ poet; the âIâ has a prominent place in his poetry and he often mentions himself and his friends by name in his poems. Due to the original way in which he expresses himself, all these personal elements become part of an interesting poetic structure. They can be connected with Ryzhii himself, but function in the first place on another level: that of the poem as a work of art.},

 abstract = {Vadim AndreevÊ¼s (1902â1976) memoir Childhood (Detstvo) was arguably the most influential text in the re-branding of Leonid Andreev (1871â1919) for the Soviet literary market in the 1960s. In this intriguing psychological description, Vadim privileges the role played by his mother in the life of his father, while minimizing the role of his stepmother, Anna IlÊ¼inichna Andreeva (1885â1948). This was complicated by Vera AndreevaÊ¼s (1910â1986) attempts to counter these claims in her own memoir A House on the Black Rivulet (Dom na Chernoi rechke), published a decade after her brotherÊ¼s. Using the critical vocabulary of Pierre Bourdieu, I will argue that there are two compelling reasons why Vadim essentially erases Anna IlÊ¼inichna from his memoir. One is personal. VadimÊ¼s experience with his stepmother was one of alienation and he isolates her in turn. The second is economic. By dividing AndreevÊ¼s life into two halves in which relative values are given to each based on family and locale, Vadim positions himself as the only remaining representative of his fatherÊ¼s posthumous legacy. Childhood was meant to increase his own symbolic capital beyond that of his living relatives. In the phraseology of Bourdieu, Vadim wished to be the lone creator of the creator.},

@article{WHITE201749,
 abstract = {This article discusses how some Russian satirical journals capitalized on the medical discourse of degeneration shortly after the 1905 Revolution in order to stigmatize certain decadent literary figures as degenerate purveyors of social unrest. This is not an exhaustive examination of the role of satirical journals in this process, but an indicator that the scientific discourse of degeneration was not limited to medical journals, academic lectures and literary salons. Along with this medical discourse, the designation âdecadentâ became an abusive moniker that was used to stigmatize the writer as a deviant and degenerate psychopath. This article suggests that as a result, medical theory played a more important role in shaping the popular discourse of the Russian fin de siÃ¨cle than has been previously discussed. In fact, this stigmatizing discourse was quite prevalent, by which criticism of literary decadence was intertwined with the medical pathology of degeneration. Russian satirical journals played a role in this process by popularizing this medical discourse for readers, combining the latest theories on degeneration with sensational accounts of alcoholics, drug addicts and syphilitics, while at the same time depicting modernists as morally corrupt transmitters of social and political discontent.},

 abstract = {A religious experiencing of the world, a search for some stance on matters of spiritual integrity, permeated the entire critical oeuvre of the founder of modern Czech art criticism, F.X. Å alda, though in many different, and often surprising, ways. Many later interpreters of his work have pointed to the key role played by his belief in an absolute spiritual principle that gave order to his ideas about art and culture, or to the role of religious thought as the pivot of his convictions, indeed his entire personality. During the almost fifty years of Å alda's creative life, this âdesire for integrationâ, or spiritual synthesis, evinced many different, often contradictory, forms, yet invariably directed towards encapsulating that unity of variables, the entirety of life and one's role within it. His relationship to religious discourse in literature and art, an issue which he raised time and again with both trepidation and a determination to arrive at some rational, systematic resolution, permits us an insight into how he approached the problem of inner unity and thus into the overall moulding of his attitude to life, the world and art. Hence I shall focus here on three particular stages in Å alda's career as critic and poet where â with a different variable each time â he broaches this troublesome relationship.},

 abstract = {This article examines the Arabian Nights subtext of Venedikt Erofeevâs Moskva-Petushki, proposing that the subtext is far more extensive and relevant than previously recognized. This subtext highlights the tension in the book between linear and circular narratives, and the vicious circles Venichka hopes to escape. The Arabian Nights subtext challenges the way we read the book, hinting that Moskva-Petushki is a book that emulates its redemptive subtexts but omits the frame stories that reveal this redemption. In such an interpretation, we see that Venichka is playing the role of the holy fool, or the storyteller Scheherazade, and that his primary audience is not his train companions nor the conductor who calls him Scheherazade, but the reader; it is therefore by his effect on the reader that the bookâs success or failure as a redemptive story should be measured.},

 abstract = {Sergei Tretâiakov is considered the pioneer of an ethnographic turn within the segment of âfactographyâ in Soviet avant-garde literature. This article re-evaluates this assumption by examining his pieces for Novyi LEF in 1927 and 1928 and his pivotal contributions to the 1929 anthology Literatura fakta (Literature of Fact). The author focuses on Tretâiakovâs appropriation of Vladimir Arsenâevâs ethnographic writing and devotes special attention to his review of the latterâs V debriakh Ussuriiskogo kraia (In the Wilds of Ussuriland, 1926/1928) â celebrated by Tretâiakov as âone of the most remarkable books in the field of factual proseâ. The analysis confronts Tretiakovâs invention and practice of factography with Arsenâevâs prose and his scriptwriting collaboration on Aleksandr Litvinovâs ethnographic film Lesnye liudi (Forest people, 1928). Whereas Tretâiakov pursues codified signification and a rational approach towards the recording of facts, disregarding âprimitiveâ perception, Arsenâev emphasises the nativeâs mimetic ability to perceive and communicate sensual phenomena beyond verbal or analogue codes. Thus, where Tretâiakov aims for a non-hierarchical participatory observation, Arsenâev, in part, achieves it.},

It is often assumed to foreground the protagonist, who is modeled after PuÅ¡kinÊ¼s African great-grandfather. Yet as I argue, the work is fundamentally about two genesis myths: one centers around the figure of Ibragim âThe Blackamoorâ, and the other around Peter the Great. Ibragim is presented as the creator or progenitor of a new family â a new people. Peter the Great, the Creator of the new Russian state, is placed in the center of another creation myth. These two dimensions are intricately intertwined within the storyline of the historical narrative and suggest a troubling, complex dynamic between national and personal (hi)stories.},

 abstract = {While the poetics of space in Tolstoi's work has been extensively discussed, overseas travel in Anna Karenina remains largely unstudied. The significance of travel abroad should not be ignored, considering that all four of the novel's central characters visit Europe. Moreover, their overseas travels serve as counterpoints to one another. This article investigates these trips in an attempt to shed light on how the text's major characters experience Europe and how this experience shapes the novel artistically. To this end, Kiti's trip to Germany contrasts with Anna and Vronskii's sojourn in Italy as they take opposite directions in life. Whereas Kiti's experience in Germany helps her to grow as a person by coming to terms with her own virtues and shortcomings, Anna's quasi-honeymoon in Italy, where she basks in self-deception, only accelerates her moral decline. Petrov and Mikhailov, two Russian painters living abroad, play a role in this contrast. Unlike these travel story lines, the one surrounding Levin's trip to Europe stands out for its lack of concrete details, even though the event is significant and allows him to gain confidence in the realms of both existential and intellectual growth. Levin's âsilentâ tour of Europe contributes to establishing the contrapuntal parallelism in the novel.},

 abstract = {Anna Karenina is not only a novel about the family, but also a seismograph of its time. In particular, it shows the crisis that the institution of arranged marriage was going through in the second half of the19th century. The novel offers a new possible model for how a couple might behave, and anticipates the future bourgeois marriage that Tolstoi will depict in The Kreutzer Sonata. In a literary-centric society like that of Russia, there is no doubt that TolstoiÊ¼s novel, Anna Karenina, influenced readersÊ¼ mentalities, but what emerges from an analysis of the literary criticism of that time is that the message of the novel was not immediately perceived. Critics were too engaged in liberal or conservative questions to understand the thoroughly subversive message of the novel concerning family matters. In any case, what the history of ideas shows us is that some representations do penetrate the lower levels of our consciousness only to emerge on the surface years later. In fact they surface in the 1890s when an international debate bursts out about The Kreutzer Sonata.},

Anna showed a new possible way of union based on feelings and the Great Reform created the conditions to realize it. In this way the transition from the aristocratic marriage of convenience to the bourgeois marriage, represented in âThe Kreutzer Sonataâ, was brought to fruition. In this late work, Tolstoi posed the sexual problem in new terms, as the modern marriage involved a new idea of love, sex and conjugal union. The first to pronounce this new word was Pozdnyshev, through a series of scandalous statements, which provoked violent reactions from all sides. Thus Tolstoi gave impulse to the rise of a new regime of sexual discourses connected with hygiene, medicine, pedagogy, criminality and demography.},

 abstract = {In the summer of 1926, three great poets of the twentieth century â Tsvetaeva, Pasternak, and Rilke â exchanged letters. This three-way epistolary exchange conducted by all three poets in German ended several months later, after Rilke's death from leukemia. The correspondence first saw the light in the German edition in the 1980's, then, gradually, it started appearing in other languages, including Russian. It has drawn comments from such a notable critic as Susan Sontag. Tsvetaeva's long poem, âNovogodneeâ, written shortly after Rilke's death, was analyzed extensively by Joseph Brodsky. In my paper, I provide brief readings of three literary tributes to Rilke by Tsvetaeva and Pasternak. I use the psychological concept of âempathic attunementâ, worked out by the prominent psychologist Heinz Kohut. I find that reading the literary tributes through the concept of empathy points to the human, as opposed to the mythical side of this fascinating literary triangle.},

 abstract = {The introduction to the special issue cluster explores the complexity and ambiguity inherent in the position of a censor in the Imperial Russia. On the one hand, the censor was a law enforcement agent whose job was to constrain and constrict. At the same time, the act of censoring works of literature or music demanded multiplex interactions between the censor and different participants in the creation and dissemination of these works and thus could never be âneutralâ or âobjectiveâ towards the aesthetical and cultural dimensions of art. Instead of representing censorship exclusively as an extension of governmental oppressive politics, recent approaches to studying censorship have focused on cultural practices of censors and the censorsâ reciprocal interactions with writers, artists and philosophers. By and large, this trend has been absent from the historiography of Russian censorship. The interdisciplinary cluster of articles in this issue illuminates anew the multifarious relationship between the Censorship Departmentâs officials in Russia of Nicholas I and Alexander II and the authors of the works they reviewed.},

Although the phenomenon has its parallels in literature, it is prominently manifest in the pictorial arts. It cannot be reduced to a single denominator but can be distinguished in four categories in which the focus is on object, subject, or both, or on the viewer respectively. The author analyses some paintings, in particular one by the artist Kliment Red'ko. Other artists discussed are the later Malevich and Filonov.},

 abstract = {The article analyses the structural and stylistic aspects of the motif of the dial as it occurs in Russian pictorial art from Symbolism until the end of the Avant-Garde in the 1920s. The contamination of linear and cyclical time and the various geometric forms of the dial appear as âshimmeringâ mythology in the visual narrative. The motif of the dial or clock has many meanings and connotations: vanitas in the work of Petrov-Vodkin, the Eternal Return in Chagall, a part of MalevichÊ¼s strategy to gain possession of cyclical time. In the literature of the 1920sâ1930s we find the mythopoetics of the clock in, for instance, the work of MandelÊ¼shtam and Polonskaia.},

 abstract = {The mythological essence of Maksimilian Voloshin's poetry reveals the intertwined meanings of stone that belongs both to nature and to culture. It colors the motif of stone with anthropological semantics (a stone manifests itself as an animated being) and defines the active syntactic position of the word âstoneâ. Living stone in Voloshin's poetry directly corresponds to his paintings: his nearly monochrome Crimea watercolors of the 1920s resemble stones and evoke features of the so-called âlandscape stoneâ, that produces an image by activating the onlooker's fantasy. In this way the traditional motif of stone located in Voloshin's Symbolist poetics makes a breakthrough to the avant-garde poetics with its free link between signifier and signified. The present semiotic analysis has been based on the National Corpus of Russian Language (www.ruscorpora.ru). It also discusses the occurrence of this motif in other Symbolist poets.},

 abstract = {Aleksandr Ostrovskii, the best known and very prolific Russian playwright of the nineteenth century, interacted constantly with the officials responsible for dramatic censorship, considered by most of Ostrovskiiâs contemporaries the most brutal branch of the censorship apparatus. The censor and, independently, Nicholas I personally, did not allow Ostrovskii to stage his first major play. A similar fate awaited some of his later plays. By the mid-1850âs, Ostrovskii had accumulated significant symbolic capital and officials from the Censorship Department started avoiding conflicts with him. Instead, they tried to draw him to their side by interpreting his works in a light that would render them suitable to the requirements for dramatic works. Ostrovskii, from the beginning of his career, tried not so much to avoid conflicts with the censorship and cuts to his plays as to provide the censor with a way to interpret his works that would not require them to be banned. The present article analyzes both the history of such attempts by Ostrovskii and his censors to find common ground, and the reasons why these attempts turned out to be not entirely effective. Using material from the censorship archives, I attempt to demonstrate that such attempts changed the playwrightâs status.},

 abstract = {The paper concerns representations of the peasantry in Russian plays of 1855â1876. It is focused on a group of plays that was submitted for the âUvarov Awardâ, the first literary prize in Russia. This unique source allows us to compare plays by outstanding playwrights and professional stage writers of the time, who provided theaters with ample production for everyday use, with writings by amateurs. The authors focus on a common pattern of representation, in which peasants transgress the borders of their estate (soslovie); most plays focus on marriage or a love story that forces a peasant woman to change her social status. The recurring employment of these tropes was most likely used to reflect the rapid growth of social mobility and the weakening of stable borders of estates in the age of reforms of Alexander II. The most outspoken version of this transgression can be discovered in award-winning The Bitter Fate by A.F. Pisemskii. The members of the committee that was responsible for distributing the awards believed that the play allowed viewers of different social strata to join, thus transgressing the borders of estates not only on the stage, but also in the auditorium.},

 abstract = {This article explores trolling as a form of literary activity. It presents a number of specific types of trolling on the Russian-language Internet in connection with digital literature and the literary practices of various groups of Internet users. Techniques for writing provocative âtroll-textsâ were created and developed within subcultural groups in the 1990s. Later, from being a subversive practice known only to a few insiders, it became a mass technique described in meta-texts that identified rules for trolling and shared facts about its culture with all interested users. In the 2010s, the now popularised techniques of trolling came to be seen as effective strategies to deploy in online debates. At the same time, trolling began to be exploited as a weapon in online political campaigns. This study also shows that trolling texts are often structured around the fight for voice, and it is this conflict that dictates the formal properties of the discourse of trolling.},
